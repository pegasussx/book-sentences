## Introduction — A Personal Statement

A speaker stood before a group of alcoholics determined to demonstrate to them, once and for all, that alcohol was an evil beyond compare. On the platform he had what appeared to be two identical containers of clear fluid. He announced that one contained pure water and the other was filled with undiluted alcohol. He placed a small worm in the container while everyone watched as it swam around and headed for the side of the glass, whereupon it simply crawled to the top of the glass. He then took the same worm and placed it in the container with alcohol. The worm disintegrated right before their eyes. “There,” said the speaker. “What’s the moral?” A voice from the rear of the room said quite clearly, “I see that if you drink alcohol, you’ll never have worms.”

This book has a lot of “worms”... ...you will hear and perceive exactly what you want to hear based upon many of your own values.

Looking at yourself in depth with an eye toward changing might be something that you say you are interested in accomplishing, but your behavior often speaks otherwise.

Change is tough.

Mental health should be treated in a flip manner, neither... ...it must be a humorless enterprise... ...I have tried to avoid intricate explanations, because I do not believe that “being happy” is a complex affair.

Being healthy is a natural state, and the means for achieving it are within the grasp of each one of us.

Hard work, clear thinking, humor and self-confidence are the ingredients of effective living.

You don’t need a professional background in counseling and a doctorate in the helping professions to understand the principles of effective living... ...You learn them by being committed to your own happiness and by doing something about it... ...every day.

Each chapter of this book is written like a counseling session... ...A particular erroneous zone, or kind of self-destructive behavior, is explored, and the historical antecedents for the behavior in our culture (and therefore in you) are examined.

Helping you understand _why_ you are trapped in this self-defeating zone.

Behaviors that fall into this erroneous zone are detailed... ...that may seem perfectly acceptable, but are, in reality, harmful to your own happiness.

After a look at the behaviors... ...examination of the _reasons_ for hanging onto behavior which does not make you happy... ...look at the psychological support system that you have erected to maintain self- defeating behavior, rather than giving it up.

Answer the questions, “What do I get out of my behavior?” and “Why does it persist if it is injurious to me?”

The reasons for keeping neurotic behavior are fairly consistent across all of the erroneous zones.

It is safer to hang onto a learned response, even if it is self-destructive. Moreover, you can eliminate having to change and take responsibility if you keep the erroneous zones intact.

Your psychological maintenance system functions to keep blame off you and the opportunity for change at bay.

The fact that you maintain many self-defeating behaviors for the same reason only makes total growth more approachable. Eliminate these reasons and you’ll eradicate your erroneous zones.

Each chapter concludes with some straightforward strategies for eliminating self-nullifying behavior.

Counseling session is all about... ...exploration of the... ...self-defeating behavior,... ...the “Why” of the behavior and concrete strategies for eliminating the troublesome area.

Effective thinking—thinking which can alter self-destructive behavior— does not occur just because something is said. An insight must be repeated, and repeated, and repeated again. Only then, when it is fully accepted and understood, do you begin to alter behavior.

Two central themes... ...The first involves your ability to make choices about your own emotions.

Begin to examine your life in the light of choices you have made or failed to make. This puts all responsibility for what you are and how you feel on you.

Becoming happier and more effective will mean becoming more aware of the choices that are available to you.

YOU ARE THE SUM TOTAL OF YOUR CHOICES.

With an appropriate amount of motivation and effort you can be anything you choose.

The second theme... ...taking charge of your present moments.

There is only one moment in which you can experience anything, and that is now, yet a great deal of time is thrown away by dwelling on past or future experiences.

Turning your now into total fulfillment is the touchstone of effective living, and virtually all self-defeating behaviors (erroneous zones) are efforts at living in a moment other than the current one.

Choice and present-moment living will be stressed on almost every page of this book.

You’ll soon begin to ask yourself... ...“Why am I choosing to feel upset right now?” and “How can I make more effective use of my present moments?”... ...moving away from erroneous zones toward self- reliance and happiness.

Twenty-five questions designed to measure your capacity to choose happiness and fulfillment... ...assess yourself and how you live your present moments. “Yes” responses indicate personal mastery and effective choice-making.

At any given moment of your life, you can choose to say yes to all of the questions above if you are willing to repeal many “shoulds” and “oughts” that you have learned throughout your life.

The real choice is whether you decide to be personally free or remain chained to the expectations that others have of you.

> I want to travel as far as I can go, I want to reach the joy that’s in my soul, And change the limitations that I know, And feel my mind and spirit grow; I want to live, exist, “to be,” And hear the truths inside of me.
> —Doris Warshay. New Directions poem

This book will help you to eliminate any “worms”... ...that may be keeping you from beautiful new experiences and to discover and choose your own new directions.

## 1 Taking Charge of Yourself

The essence of greatness is the ability to choose personal fulfillment in circumstances where others choose madness.

A constant companion... ...call him _Your-Own-Death._ You can fear this visitor or use him for your personal gain. The choice is up to you.

“Should I avoid doing the things I really want to do?” “Should I live my life as others want me to?” “Are things important to accumulate?” “Is putting it off the way to live?”... ...answers can be summed up in a few words: Live...Be You...Enjoy...Love.

The next time you are contemplating a decision in which you are debating whether or not to... ...make your own choice, ask yourself an important question, “How long am I going to be dead?”... ...make your own choice and leave the worrying... ...to those who are going to be alive forever.

If you don’t begin taking these steps, you can anticipate living your entire life the way others say you must.

It’s your life; do with it what _you_ want.

### Happiness and Your Own I.Q.

Taking charge of yourself involves putting to rest some very prevalent myths.

Intelligence is measured by your ability to solve complex problems... ...This vision of intelligence... ...encourages a kind of intellectual snobbery that has brought with it some demoralizing results.

A truer barometer of intelligence is an effective, happy life lived each day and each present moment of every day.

If you are happy, if you live each moment for everything it’s worth, then you are an intelligent person.

Problem solving is a useful adjunct to your happiness, but if you know that given your inability to resolve a particular concern you can still choose happiness for yourself, or at a minimum refuse to choose unhappiness, then you are intelligent.

You are intelligent because you have the ultimate weapon against the big N.B.D. Yep—_N_ervous _B_reak _D_own.

“Intelligent” people do not have N.B.D.’s because they are in charge of themselves. They know how to choose happiness over depression, because they know how to deal with the _problems_ of their lives.

I didn’t say _solve_ the problems. Rather than measuring their intelligence on their ability to _solve_ the problem, they measure it on their capacity for maintaining themselves as happy and worthy, whether the problem gets solved or not.

You can begin to think of yourself as truly intelligent on the basis of how you choose to feel in the face of trying circumstances.

The life struggles are pretty much the same for each of us... ...Disagreements, conflicts and compromises are a part of what it means to be human.

Some people are able to... ...avoid immobilizing dejection and unhappiness... ...while others collapse.

Those who recognize problems as a human condition and don’t measure happiness by an absence of problems are the most intelligent kind of humans we know; also, the most rare.

Learning to take total charge of yourself will involve a whole new thinking process... ...difficult because too many forces in our society conspire against individual responsibility.

You must trust in your own ability to feel emotionally whatever you choose to feel at any time in your life.

You’ve grown up believing that you can’t control your own emotions; that anger, fear and hate, as well as love, ecstasy and joy are things that happen to you. An individual doesn’t control these things, he accepts them... ...and hope that some happy events will come along so that you can feel good very soon.

### Choosing How You’ll Feel

Feelings are not just emotions that happen to you. Feelings are reactions you choose to have.

If you are in charge of your own emotions, you don’t have to choose self-defeating reactions.

You can feel what you choose to feel.

The road to “intelligence”... ...will be new because you’ll see a given emotion as a choice rather than as a condition of life. This is the very heart and soul of personal freedom.

Attack the myth of not being in charge of your emotions through logic.

Syllogism (a formulation in logic, in which you have a major premise, a minor premise and a conclusion based upon the agreement between the two premises).
