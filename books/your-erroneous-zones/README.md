## Introduction — A Personal Statement

A speaker stood before a group of alcoholics determined to demonstrate to them, once and for all, that alcohol was an evil beyond compare. On the platform he had what appeared to be two identical containers of clear fluid. He announced that one contained pure water and the other was filled with undiluted alcohol. He placed a small worm in the container while everyone watched as it swam around and headed for the side of the glass, whereupon it simply crawled to the top of the glass. He then took the same worm and placed it in the container with alcohol. The worm disintegrated right before their eyes. “There,” said the speaker. “What’s the moral?” A voice from the rear of the room said quite clearly, “I see that if you drink alcohol, you’ll never have worms.”

This book has a lot of “worms”... ...you will hear and perceive exactly what you want to hear based upon many of your own values.

Looking at yourself in depth with an eye toward changing might be something that you say you are interested in accomplishing, but your behavior often speaks otherwise.

Change is tough.

Mental health should be treated in a flip manner, neither... ...it must be a humorless enterprise... ...I have tried to avoid intricate explanations, because I do not believe that “being happy” is a complex affair.

Being healthy is a natural state, and the means for achieving it are within the grasp of each one of us.

Hard work, clear thinking, humor and self-confidence are the ingredients of effective living.

You don’t need a professional background in counseling and a doctorate in the helping professions to understand the principles of effective living... ...You learn them by being committed to your own happiness and by doing something about it... ...every day.

Each chapter of this book is written like a counseling session... ...A particular erroneous zone, or kind of self-destructive behavior, is explored, and the historical antecedents for the behavior in our culture (and therefore in you) are examined.

Helping you understand _why_ you are trapped in this self-defeating zone.

Behaviors that fall into this erroneous zone are detailed... ...that may seem perfectly acceptable, but are, in reality, harmful to your own happiness.

After a look at the behaviors... ...examination of the _reasons_ for hanging onto behavior which does not make you happy... ...look at the psychological support system that you have erected to maintain self- defeating behavior, rather than giving it up.
