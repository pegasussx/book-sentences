## Introduction — A Personal Statement

A speaker stood before a group of alcoholics determined to demonstrate to them, once and for all, that alcohol was an evil beyond compare. On the platform he had what appeared to be two identical containers of clear fluid. He announced that one contained pure water and the other was filled with undiluted alcohol. He placed a small worm in the container while everyone watched as it swam around and headed for the side of the glass, whereupon it simply crawled to the top of the glass. He then took the same worm and placed it in the container with alcohol. The worm disintegrated right before their eyes. “There,” said the speaker. “What’s the moral?” A voice from the rear of the room said quite clearly, “I see that if you drink alcohol, you’ll never have worms.”

This book has a lot of “worms”... ...you will hear and perceive exactly what you want to hear based upon many of your own values.

Looking at yourself in depth with an eye toward changing might be something that you say you are interested in accomplishing, but your behavior often speaks otherwise.

Change is tough.

Mental health should be treated in a flip manner, neither... ...it must be a humorless enterprise... ...I have tried to avoid intricate explanations, because I do not believe that “being happy” is a complex affair.

Being healthy is a natural state, and the means for achieving it are within the grasp of each one of us.

Hard work, clear thinking, humor and self-confidence are the ingredients of effective living.

You don’t need a professional background in counseling and a doctorate in the helping professions to understand the principles of effective living... ...You learn them by being committed to your own happiness and by doing something about it... ...every day.

Each chapter of this book is written like a counseling session... ...A particular erroneous zone, or kind of self-destructive behavior, is explored, and the historical antecedents for the behavior in our culture (and therefore in you) are examined.

Helping you understand _why_ you are trapped in this self-defeating zone.

Behaviors that fall into this erroneous zone are detailed... ...that may seem perfectly acceptable, but are, in reality, harmful to your own happiness.

After a look at the behaviors... ...examination of the _reasons_ for hanging onto behavior which does not make you happy... ...look at the psychological support system that you have erected to maintain self- defeating behavior, rather than giving it up.

Answer the questions, “What do I get out of my behavior?” and “Why does it persist if it is injurious to me?”

The reasons for keeping neurotic behavior are fairly consistent across all of the erroneous zones.

It is safer to hang onto a learned response, even if it is self-destructive. Moreover, you can eliminate having to change and take responsibility if you keep the erroneous zones intact.

Your psychological maintenance system functions to keep blame off you and the opportunity for change at bay.

The fact that you maintain many self-defeating behaviors for the same reason only makes total growth more approachable. Eliminate these reasons and you’ll eradicate your erroneous zones.

Each chapter concludes with some straightforward strategies for eliminating self-nullifying behavior.

Counseling session is all about... ...exploration of the... ...self-defeating behavior,... ...the “Why” of the behavior and concrete strategies for eliminating the troublesome area.

Effective thinking—thinking which can alter self-destructive behavior— does not occur just because something is said. An insight must be repeated, and repeated, and repeated again. Only then, when it is fully accepted and understood, do you begin to alter behavior.

Two central themes... ...The first involves your ability to make choices about your own emotions.

Begin to examine your life in the light of choices you have made or failed to make. This puts all responsibility for what you are and how you feel on you.

Becoming happier and more effective will mean becoming more aware of the choices that are available to you.

YOU ARE THE SUM TOTAL OF YOUR CHOICES.

With an appropriate amount of motivation and effort you can be anything you choose.

The second theme... ...taking charge of your present moments.

There is only one moment in which you can experience anything, and that is now, yet a great deal of time is thrown away by dwelling on past or future experiences.

Turning your now into total fulfillment is the touchstone of effective living, and virtually all self-defeating behaviors (erroneous zones) are efforts at living in a moment other than the current one.

Choice and present-moment living will be stressed on almost every page of this book.

You’ll soon begin to ask yourself... ...“Why am I choosing to feel upset right now?” and “How can I make more effective use of my present moments?”... ...moving away from erroneous zones toward self- reliance and happiness.

Twenty-five questions designed to measure your capacity to choose happiness and fulfillment... ...assess yourself and how you live your present moments. “Yes” responses indicate personal mastery and effective choice-making.

At any given moment of your life, you can choose to say yes to all of the questions above if you are willing to repeal many “shoulds” and “oughts” that you have learned throughout your life.

The real choice is whether you decide to be personally free or remain chained to the expectations that others have of you.

> I want to travel as far as I can go, I want to reach the joy that’s in my soul, And change the limitations that I know, And feel my mind and spirit grow; I want to live, exist, “to be,” And hear the truths inside of me.
> —Doris Warshay. New Directions poem

This book will help you to eliminate any “worms”... ...that may be keeping you from beautiful new experiences and to discover and choose your own new directions.

## 1 Taking Charge of Yourself

The essence of greatness is the ability to choose personal fulfillment in circumstances where others choose madness.

A constant companion... ...call him _Your-Own-Death._ You can fear this visitor or use him for your personal gain. The choice is up to you.

“Should I avoid doing the things I really want to do?” “Should I live my life as others want me to?” “Are things important to accumulate?” “Is putting it off the way to live?”... ...answers can be summed up in a few words: Live...Be You...Enjoy...Love.

The next time you are contemplating a decision in which you are debating whether or not to... ...make your own choice, ask yourself an important question, “How long am I going to be dead?”... ...make your own choice and leave the worrying... ...to those who are going to be alive forever.

If you don’t begin taking these steps, you can anticipate living your entire life the way others say you must.

It’s your life; do with it what _you_ want.

### Happiness and Your Own I.Q.

Taking charge of yourself involves putting to rest some very prevalent myths.

Intelligence is measured by your ability to solve complex problems... ...This vision of intelligence... ...encourages a kind of intellectual snobbery that has brought with it some demoralizing results.

A truer barometer of intelligence is an effective, happy life lived each day and each present moment of every day.

If you are happy, if you live each moment for everything it’s worth, then you are an intelligent person.

Problem solving is a useful adjunct to your happiness, but if you know that given your inability to resolve a particular concern you can still choose happiness for yourself, or at a minimum refuse to choose unhappiness, then you are intelligent.

You are intelligent because you have the ultimate weapon against the big N.B.D. Yep—_N_ervous _B_reak _D_own.

“Intelligent” people do not have N.B.D.’s because they are in charge of themselves. They know how to choose happiness over depression, because they know how to deal with the _problems_ of their lives.

I didn’t say _solve_ the problems. Rather than measuring their intelligence on their ability to _solve_ the problem, they measure it on their capacity for maintaining themselves as happy and worthy, whether the problem gets solved or not.

You can begin to think of yourself as truly intelligent on the basis of how you choose to feel in the face of trying circumstances.

The life struggles are pretty much the same for each of us... ...Disagreements, conflicts and compromises are a part of what it means to be human.

Some people are able to... ...avoid immobilizing dejection and unhappiness... ...while others collapse.

Those who recognize problems as a human condition and don’t measure happiness by an absence of problems are the most intelligent kind of humans we know; also, the most rare.

Learning to take total charge of yourself will involve a whole new thinking process... ...difficult because too many forces in our society conspire against individual responsibility.

You must trust in your own ability to feel emotionally whatever you choose to feel at any time in your life.

You’ve grown up believing that you can’t control your own emotions; that anger, fear and hate, as well as love, ecstasy and joy are things that happen to you. An individual doesn’t control these things, he accepts them... ...and hope that some happy events will come along so that you can feel good very soon.

### Choosing How You’ll Feel

Feelings are not just emotions that happen to you. Feelings are reactions you choose to have.

If you are in charge of your own emotions, you don’t have to choose self-defeating reactions.

You can feel what you choose to feel.

The road to “intelligence”... ...will be new because you’ll see a given emotion as a choice rather than as a condition of life. This is the very heart and soul of personal freedom.

Attack the myth of not being in charge of your emotions through logic.

Syllogism (a formulation in logic, in which you have a major premise, a minor premise and a conclusion based upon the agreement between the two premises).

Logic—Syllogism
MAJOR PREMISE: Aristotle is a Man. MINOR PREMISE: All men have facial hair. CONCLUSION: ARISTOTLE HAS FACIAL HAIR.

Illogic—Syllogism 
MAJOR PREMISE: Aristotle has facial hair. MINOR PREMISE: All men have facial hair. CONCLUSION: ARISTOTLE IS A MAN.

In the second illustration, Aristotle could be an ape or a mole.

logical exercise that can forever put to rest the notion that you cannot take charge of your own emotional world. MAJOR PREMISE: I can control my thoughts. MINOR PREMISE: My feelings come from my thoughts. CONCLUSION: I can control my feelings.

I can say to you, “Think of a pink antelope,” and you can turn it green, or make it an aardvark, or simply think of something else if you so choose.

You alone control what enters your head as a thought.

No one else can get inside your head and have your own thoughts as you experience them. You do indeed control your thoughts, and your brain is your own to use as you so determine.

You cannot have a feeling (emotion) without first having experienced a thought. Take away your brain and your ability to “feel” is wiped out.

A feeling is a physical reaction to a thought.

Every feeling that you have was preceded by a thought, and without a brain you can have no feelings.

If you control your thoughts, and your feelings come from your thoughts, then you are capable of controlling your own feelings. And you control your feelings by working on the thoughts that preceded them.

You make yourself unhappy because of the thoughts that you have about the people or things in your life.

Becoming a free and healthy person involves learning to _think_ differently.

Once you can change your thoughts, your new feelings will begin to emerge, and you will have taken the first step on the road to your personal freedom.

Cal, a young executive who spends most of his time agonizing over the fact that his boss thinks he is stupid... ...Cal makes himself unhappy by convincing himself that what someone else thinks is more important than what he thinks.

Someone’s death does not make you unhappy; you cannot be unhappy until you learn of the death, so it’s not the death but what you tell yourself about the event.

Ask yourself, “Why should I choose depression? Will it help me to be more effective in dealing with it?”

You have grown up in a culture which has taught you that you are not responsible for your feelings even though the syllogistic truth is that you always were. You’ve learned a host of sayings to defend yourself against the fact that you do control your feelings.

- "You hurt my feelings."
- "You make me feel bad."
- "I can’t help the way I feel."
- "I just feel angry, don’t ask me to explain it." 
- "He makes me sick."
- "Heights scare me."
- "You’re embarrassing me."
- "She really turns me on."
- "You made a fool of me in public."

Rewrite the list so it is accurate, so it reflects the fact that you are in charge of how you feel and that your feelings come from the thoughts you have about anything.

- "I hurt my feelings because of the things I told myself about your reaction to me."
- "I made myself feel bad."
- "I can help the way I feel, but I’ve chosen to be upset."
- "I’ve decided to be angry, because I can usually manipulate others with my   anger, since they think I control them." 
- "I make myself sick."
- "I scare myself at high places."
- "I’m embarrassing myself."
- "I turn myself on whenever I’m near her."
- "I made myself feel foolish by taking your opinions of me more seriously than my own, and believing that others would do the same."

Why the statements in List 2 did not evolve into clichés. The answer lies in our culture, which teaches the thinking of List 1, and discourages the logic of List 2.

You feel what you think, and you can learn to think differently about anything—if you decide to do so.

Ask yourself if there is a sufficient payoff in being unhappy, down, or hurt. Then begin to examine, in depth, the kind of thoughts that are leading you to these debilitating feelings.

### Learning Not To Be Unhappy: A Tough Assignment

It is not easy to think in new ways. You are accustomed to a certain set of thoughts and the debilitating thoughts that follow.

Happiness is easy, but learning not to be unhappy can be difficult.

Happiness is a natural condition of being a person. The evidence is plainly visible when you look at young children.

Taking charge of yourself begins with awareness.

Catch yourself when you say things like, “He hurt my feelings.”... ...New thinking requires awareness of the old thinking.

You have become habituated in mental patterns that identify the causes of your feelings as outside of yourself... ...you’ll need to balance the scale with thousands of hours of new... ...thinking that assumes responsibility for your own feelings. It is tough, damn tough; but so what? That certainly is no reason to avoid doing it.

_Awareness,_ and then after thousands of trials, mistakes, new efforts.

You’ve learned the habits you now have by reinforcing them all of your life.

You have accepted your behavior and never worked at challenging it. But you can learn to not be unhappy, angry, hurt, or frustrated just as you learned to be all those self-defeating things.

A thought becomes a belief when you’ve worked on it repeatedly, not when you simply try it once and use your initial inability as the rationale for giving up.

Taking charge of yourself involves more than simply trying on new thoughts for size. It requires a determination to be happy and to challenge and destroy each and every thought that creates a self-immobilizing unhappiness in you.

### Choice—Your Ultimate Freedom

If you still believe that you don’t choose to be unhappy, try to imagine this course of events. Each time you become unhappy you are subjected to some treatment you find unpleasant... ...How long do you think you would continue to hold on to them? Chances are you would take control rather quickly.

The issue is not whether you can take control of your feelings, but whether you will.

What must you endure before you’ll make such a choice? Some people choose to go insane rather than take control. Others merely give up and succumb to a life of misery because the dividend of pity received is greater than the reward of being happy.

The issue here is your own ability to choose happiness or at least not to choose unhappiness.

To discard it is to give up on yourself.

Just as you are free to choose happiness over unhappiness... ...you are free to choose self-fulfilling behavior over self- defeating behavior.

Substitute in slow progressive steps healthy new feelings and habits for old self- defeating emotions.

You can choose to make any experience enjoyable and challenging. Dull parties and committee meetings are fertile territory for choosing new feelings.

When you find yourself bored, you can make your mind work in exciting ways, by changing the subject with a key observation, or writing the first chapter of your novel, or working on new plans which will help you to avoid these settings in the future.

Using your mind actively means assessing the people and events which give you the greatest difficulty and then deciding on new mental efforts to make them work for you.

Think first of why you should not choose to be upset because someone or something is not going the way you would like it to go.

Don’t just get perturbed. Use your brain to work for you, and eventually you’ll have the terrific habit of not being upset when things go wrong.

### Choosing Health Over Illness

You can also choose to eliminate some physical sufferings which are not rooted in a known organic dysfunction.

There is a burgeoning amount of evidence to support the notion that people even choose things like tumors... ...and many other infirmities, including cancer, which have always been considered something that just happens to people.

Helping the patient not to want the disease... ...may be a means of ameliorating the internal killer.

The human brain can store an amount of information equivalent to one hundred trillion words, and all of us use but a tiny fraction of this storage space.

It’s not uncommon for individuals to become mysteriously sick when confronted with some kind of difficult circumstance, or to avoid illness when being sick is simply “impossible” at that time, and so postponed the effects, perhaps the fever, until the big event is over, and then collapse.

Listen to the advertisements we see and hear on television. “I’m a stockbroker.... So you can imagine the tension and headaches I must have. I take this pill to make it go away.” Message: You can’t control how you feel if you work in certain kinds of jobs (teachers, executives, parents) so rely on something else to do it for you. We are bombarded with messages like this every day.

We are helpless prisoners who must have someone or something else do things for us. NONSENSE. Only you can improve your lot or make yourself happy.

It is up to you to take control of your own mind, and then practice feeling and behaving in the ways that you choose.

### Avoiding Immobilization

Keep in mind the word _immobilization_ as the indicator of negative emotions in your life.

You might believe that anger, hostility, shyness and other similar feelings are worth having at times, and so you want to hang onto them.

Immobilization can range from total inaction to mild indecision and hesitancy. Does your anger keep you from saying, feeling, or doing something? If so, then you are immobilized.

_Immobilization:_ A state, however mild or serious, in which you are not functioning at the level that you would like to. If feelings lead to such a state, you need to look no further for a reason to get rid of them.

_You are immobilized when_...
You can’t talk lovingly to your spouse and children though you want to. You can’t work on a project that interests you.
You don’t make love and would like to.
You sit in the house all day and brood.
You don’t play golf, tennis, or other enjoyable activities, because of a leftover gnawing feeling.
You can’t introduce yourself to someone who appeals to you.

All negative emotions result in some degree of self-immobility, and this alone is a solid reason for eliminating them entirely from your life.

If you yell at others not to make a point, but because you are internally upset, then you’ve immobilized yourself, and it’s time to begin working at new choices that will help you to reach your goal... ...without experiencing feelings that are hurtful to you.

### The Importance of Living in the Present Moment

One way to combat immobilization... ...is to learn to live in the present moment.

Getting in touch with your “now,” is at the heart of effective living.

Now is all there is, and the future is just another present moment to live when it arrives... ...you cannot live it until it does appear.

We live in a culture which deemphasizes the now. Save for the future! Consider the consequences. Don’t be a hedonist. Think of tomorrow. Plan for your retirement.

We are continually being conditioned to sacrifice the present for the future.

Carried to its logical conclusion, this attitude is... ...an evasion of happiness forever. When the future does arrive it becomes the present and we must use it to prepare for the future. Happiness is something for the morrow and therefore ever elusive.

The present moment, that elusive time which is always with you, can be most beautifully experienced if you allow yourself to get lost in it.

Drink in all of every moment and tune out that past which is over and the future which will arrive in time.

Wishing, hoping and regretting are the most common and dangerous tactics for evading the present.

Frequently avoidance of the present leads to idealization of the future.

At some miraculous moment in the future life will change, everything will fall into place, and you will find happiness.

When you achieve that special event... ...then life will begin in earnest. More often than not when the event arrives it will be disappointing. It will never live up to what you had imagined.

When an event doesn’t live up to your expectations you can get out of the depression by idealizing again. Don’t let this vicious circle become your life-style. Interrupt it now with some strategic present-moment fulfillment.

> “Live all you can; it’s a mistake not to. It doesn’t so much matter what you do in particular, so long as you have your life. If you haven’t had that what have you had?...What one loses one loses, make no mistake about that.... The right time is any time that one is still so lucky as to have.... Live!”
> —Henry James, The Ambassadors 1903

As you look back on your life... ...you seldom experience regret for anything that you’ve done. It is what you haven’t done that will torment you.

Seize every second of your life and savor it.

Value your present moments. Using them up in any self-defeating ways means you’ve lost them forever.

The people who know how to grab that present moment and maximize it are the people who have chosen a free, effective and fulfilling life. It is a choice each of us can make.

### Growth vs. Imperfection as Motivators

In your quest to become as happy and fulfilled in your life as you choose to be, you can be motivated by two types of need. The more common form of motivation is called imperfection or deficiency motivation, while the healthier variety is labeled growth motivation.

How do you distinguish between a flower that is alive and one that is dead? The one that is growing is alive. The only evidence of life is growth!

If you are growing, you are alive. If you are not growing then you might as well be dead.

You can be motivated out of a desire to grow rather than a need to repair your deficiencies. If you recognize that you can always grow, improve, become more and greater, that is enough.

When you decide to be immobilized or to experience hurtful emotions, you’ve made a nongrowth decision.

Growth motivation means using your life energy for greater happiness, rather than having to improve yourself because you’ve sinned or because you are in some way incomplete.

A corollary of choosing growth as motivation is personal mastery in every present moment of your life.

Mastery means you are the decider of your fate... ...you choose what your world will be for you.

> People are always blaming their circumstances for what they are. I don’t believe in circumstances. The people who get on in this world are the people who get up and look for the circumstances they want, and if they can’t find them, make them.
> —George Bernard, Mrs. Warren’s Profession

Changing the way you think, or feel, or live is possible but never easy.

If you were told, at point of gun, that within one year you would have to complete a difficult task... ...You would practice, practice, practice, never yielding to the temptation to quit or slack off. And you would deliver, and consequently save your life.

No one expects to train his body overnight and yet too many of us expect our minds to respond with just such alacrity.

If you really want to be neurosis-free, self-fulfilled and in control of your own choices, if you really want to achieve present-moment happiness, you will need to apply the same kind of rigid application to the task of unlearning the self-defeating thinking you have learned up until now that you would give to the learning of any difficult enterprise... ...you’ll need to repeat endlessly that your mind really is your own and that you are capable of controlling your own feelings.

You can choose, and your present moments are yours for the enjoying—if you decide to be in charge of you.

## 2 First Love

Self-worth cannot be verified by others. You are worthy because you say it is so. If you depend on others for your value it is other-worth.

You may have a social disease... ...You are quite possibly infected with the sepsis of low-esteem, and the only known cure is a massive dose of self-love.

Perhaps... ...you’ve grown up with the idea that loving yourself is wrong... ...society tells us. Love thy neighbor... ...What nobody seems to remember is love thyself, and yet that is precisely what you’re going to have to learn to do if you are to achieve present-moment happiness.

You learned as a child that loving yourself, which was a natural thing for you then, was akin to being selfish or conceited. You learned to put others ahead of you, to think of others first because that showed you were a “good” person.

You learned... ...“share your things with your cousins.” It didn’t matter that they were your treasures... ...or that mommy or daddy might not be sharing their big- people toys with others.

By adolescence society’s messages have taken root. Self-doubt is in full bloom. And the reinforcements continue as the years pass. After all, you’re not supposed to go around loving yourself. What will others think of you!

The hints are subtle and not malicious in intent, but they do keep the individual in line.

Kids never acted that way with each other, except to please older folks. Always say please and thank you, curtsy, stand up when an adult enters, ask permission to leave the table... ...The message was clear: adults are important; kids don’t count.

Others are significant; you are insignificant.

Others are significant; you are insignificant.

Don’t trust your own judgment was corollary number one, and there was a full cargo of reinforcers that came under the subheading of “politeness.” These rules, disguised under the word _manners,_ helped you to internalize the judgments of others at the expense of your own values.

How do these self-doubts get in the way? In the important area of loving others you may be having a difficult time.

Giving love to others is directly related to how much love you have for yourself.

### Love: A Suggested Definition

Love is a word that has as many definitions as there are people to define.

_The ability and willingness to allow those that you care for to be what they choose for themselves, without any insistence that they satisfy you._

How can you reach the point of being able to let others be what they choose without insisting they meet your expectations? Very simple. By loving yourself. By feeling that you are important, worthy and beautiful.

Once you recognize just how good you are, you won’t have to have others reinforce your value or values by making their behavior conform to your dictates.

If you’re secure in yourself, you neither want nor need others to be like you. For one thing, you’re unique. For another, that would rob them of their own uniqueness, and what you love in them are just those traits that make them special and separate.

You get good at loving yourself, and suddenly you’re able to love others, to give to others, and do for others by giving and doing for yourself first.

You’re not doing it for the thanks or the payoffs but because of the genuine pleasure you get from being a helper or a lover.

If the you is someone unworthy, or unloved by you, then giving becomes impossible.

if you can’t give love, neither can you receive it.

Being in love... ...starts with a self that is totally loved.

If... ...Noah could start with the premise that he was lovable, he would experience no difficulty in the “I love you.” If he didn’t get the desired, “I love you, too, Noah,” then he would see that as having nothing to do with his own self-worth, since that was intact before he ever started. Whether or not he was loved in return would be... ...whomever Noah was loving at the moment. He might want the other person’s love, but it would not be essential to his self-worth.

At no time, under no circumstance is self-hate healthier than self-love.

If you have behaved in a way that you dislike, loathing yourself will only lead to immobilization and damage... ...Learn from the error, and resolve not to repeat it but don’t associate it with your self-worth.

Never confuse your self-worth (which is a given) with your behavior, or the behavior of others toward you.

The messages of society are overpowering. “You’re a bad boy,” rather than “You’ve behaved badly.” “Mommy doesn’t like you when you behave that way” as opposed to “Mommy doesn’t like the way you behave.” The conclusions that you may have adopted from these messages are, “She doesn’t like me, I must be a nerd” instead of, “She doesn’t like me. That’s her decision, and while I don’t like it, I’m still important.”

> My mother loves me.
I feel good.
I feel good because she loves me.
My mother does not love me.
I feel bad.
I feel bad because she does not love me. I am bad because I feel bad.
I feel bad because I am bad.
I am bad because she does not love me.
She does not love me because I am bad.
> —R. D. Laing, Knots

The habits of thought of childhood are not easily outgrown.

It is tough to shed those old shackles and wipe clean those unhealed scars, but hanging onto them is even tougher when you consider the consequences.

With mental practice you can make some self-loving choices that will amaze you.

Getting good at giving and receiving love starts at home, with you, with a vow to end any low self-esteem behaviors that have become a way of life.

### Tuning into Self-Acceptance

First you must destroy the myth that you have one single self-concept, and that it is either positive or negative all of the time. You have many self-images, and they vary from moment to moment.

If you were asked, “Do you like yourself?” you might be inclined to lump all of your negative self-thoughts together into a collective “No.” Breaking down the areas of dislike into specifics will give you definite goals to work on.

Your self-portraits are as numerous as your activities, and through all of these behaviors there is always YOU, the person that you either accept or reject.

Your self-worth... ...must be unrelated to your self-assessments. You exist. You are human. That is all you need.

Your worth is determined by you, and with no need for an explanation to anyone.

Your worthiness, a given, has nothing to do with your behavior and feelings.

You may not like your behavior in a given instance, but that has nothing to do with your self-worth.

You can choose to be worthy to yourself forever, and then get on with the task of working on your self-images.

### Loving Your Body

It all begins with the physical you. Do you like your body? If you answered no, try breaking it down into its component parts... ...You’ve got to make a very long list to check yourself out thoroughly. You don’t _have_ a nice body; you are your body; and disliking it means not accepting yourself as a human being.

If they are parts of your body which can be changed, make changing them one of your goals... ...you can see them as choices you made in an earlier present moment, and make new present-moment decisions about them.

Nothing is _too_ anything... ...What you have done is bought contemporary society’s definition of beauty. Don’t let others dictate what will be attractive to you. Decide to like the physical you and declare it as worthy and attractive to you, thereby rejecting the comparisons and opinions of others.

You can decide what is pleasing and make nonacceptance of yourself a thing of the past.

You are a human being... ...But society and industry send out certain messages about the human physical condition... ...Learn masking behavior... ...Don’t accept yourself; hide the real you.

As if the way you are is unnatural and you should go around sending out cosmetic odors in order to like yourself better. So you deodorize each orifice with the right smelling stuff, because you don’t accept a part of yourself that exists in all human beings.

A thirty-two-year-old man... ...has learned to reject all of his bodily functions labeling them as disgusting and unmentionable. Frank is compulsively clean about his body to the point of being uncomfortable whenever he sweats... ...has learned to reject his natural body functions and odors... ...if him were to be totally honest about himself, and wiped out the learned messages of self-rejection, he might even be able to admit to enjoying his own body... ...While he might not wish to share those odors with others, he would at least be able to accept them in himself, tell himself that he, in fact, likes them, and experience no shame around others.

Self-acceptance means liking the entire physical you, and eliminating those cultural impositions to be proper or to merely tolerate your body when it behaves other than in a cosmetic fashion.

You can learn to take private pleasure in being you.

Many women have accepted the cultural dispatches and behave in ways that they are supposed to when it comes to their own bodies.... ...The implication is that there is something unpleasant about the natural you, the essentially human you, and only by becoming artificial can you become attractive.

That’s the saddest part, that the end product is a fraudulent you that takes the place of the natural self you carry around with you for most of your life.

You are being encouraged to reject that beautiful you.

advertisers would encourage you to do this is understandable in light of profits to be made, but that you would buy the products is less easy to understand in view of the fact that you’re choosing to throw away the real you.

Being honest with yourself in this realm is not easy, and it takes time to learn to distinguish what pleases us from what the advertising business says should please us.

### Choosing More Positive Self-Images

You can choose to think of yourself as intelligent by applying your very own standards to yourself.

The happier you make yourself, the more intelligent you are.

If you are deficient in any areas... ...it is simply the natural result of choices you have been making up until now.

If you underestimate yourself, it is because you have bought that notion, and you compare yourself to others on certain school-related variables.

You can choose to be as bright as you desire.

Aptitude is really a function of time, rather than some inborn quality.

Studies show that although most students eventually reach mastery on each learning task, some students achieve mastery much sooner than do others.

> Aptitude is the amount of time required by the learner to attain mastery of a learning task. Implicit in this formulation is the assumption that, given enough time, all students can conceivably attain mastery of a learning task.
> —John Carroll, A Model for School Learning.

With enough time and effort you could, if you so chose, master almost any skill.

Intelligence is not something that you inherited or had otherwise bestowed upon you. You are as smart as you choose to be. Not liking how smart you’ve chosen to be is mere self-contempt, which can lead only to injurious consequences in your own life.

The logic of being able to choose your self-pictures applies to all of the photographs of you that are lodged in your brain.

If you dislike the way you behave socially, you can work at changing the behavior and not confusing it with your own self-worth.

Your artistic, mechanical, athletic, musical and other abilities are largely the result of choices and should not be confused with your worthiness.

In the same light... ...your _emotional_ life being the product of your own choices.

Self-acceptance based upon what you believe to be appropriate for you is something you can make a decision about now.

There’s no reason to choose to feel unworthy, just because there are things about yourself that you’re going to improve.

List of some typically recurring behavior that falls into this category of the self-veto.
- Rejecting compliments directed at you.
- Making up excuses for why you look nice.
- Giving credit to others when it rightfully belongs to you.
- Using other-directed references when speaking.
- Having your opinions verified by others.
- Refusing to order something you want, not because you can’t afford it (although this may be your stated reason) but because you don’t feel that you’re worth it.
- Not having orgasms.
- Not buying yourself something because you think you have to buy it for someone else, although sacrificing is not necessary; or not treating yourself to the things you would like to own, because you’re not worth it.
- In a crowded room, someone yells out, “Hey, Stupid,” and you turn around.
- Using pet names for yourself (and having others use them as well) that are really put-downs.
- A girlfriend accepts a date and you feel that she is going along just to be charitable.

I once worked with a young woman who was quite attractive and obviously... ...Shirley was always searching for a sentence that would repudiate her worth... ...she didn’t believe that she was worth being loved in the first place, and so the interminable cycle of renunciation was her way of reinforcing her notions of her lack of worth.

Many of the items in the list above may appear to be petty, they nevertheless are tiny indicators of self-rejection. If you sacrifice or refuse to be extravagant with yourself... ...it is because you don’t feel you’re worth the better cut... ...These are the lessons you’ve learned and the self-denying behavior is now second nature.

Each time you engage in any kind of a self-put-down, you reinforce that old bugaboo that others have laid on you and reduce your own opportunities for any kind of love in your life.

You are too worthy to go around putting yourself down.

### Accepting Yourself Without Complaint

Self-love means accepting yourself as a worthy person because you choose to do so. Acceptance also means an absence of complaint.

Fully functioning people never complain.

Happiness means no complaining about the things over which you can do nothing.

Complaining is the refuge of those who have no self-reliance.

Permitting others to abuse you... ...helps no one. A simple question to ask will generally end this useless and unpleasant behavior. “Why are you telling me this?” or “Is there anything I can do to help you with this?”

Your complaining behavior... ...is time spent in a wasteful manner, time which might be put to better use in practicing self-loving kinds of activities... ...or helping someone else to achieve fulfillment.

Two occasions when complaining is least appreciated... ...(1) Whenever you tell someone else that you are tired. (2) Whenever you tell someone else that you don’t feel well.

If you are tired... ...complaining... ...is abusing that person. And it won’t make you less tired. The same kind of logic applies to your “not feeling well.”

Nothing is being said here about informing others of how you feel when they can help you in any small way. What is being challenged is complaining to others who can do nothing but endure the grumbling.

If you are truly working on self-love... ...you will want to work on this yourself, rather than choosing someone to lean on.

Complaining about yourself is a useless activity, and one which keeps you from effectively living your life. It encourages self-pity and immobilizes you in your efforts at giving and receiving love.

While it may get you attention, the noticing will be done in a light that will clearly cast shadows on your own happiness.

Being able to accept yourself without complaint involves an understanding of both self-love and the complaining process, which are mutually exclusive terms.

If you genuinely love you, then complaining to others who can do nothing for you becomes absurdly impossible to defend. And if you notice things in yourself (and others) that you dislike, rather than complaining you can actively set about taking the necessary corrective steps.

### Self-Love vs. Conceit

Self-love has nothing to do with the sort of behavior characterized by telling everyone how wonderful you are.

Self-love means you love yourself; it doesn’t demand the love of others. There is no need to convince others. An internal acceptance is sufficient.

### The Rewards for Not Loving Yourself

The core of learning to be an effective person— understanding why you behave in self-defeating ways.

All behavior is caused, and the road to eliminating any self-destructive behavior is strewn with the potholes of misunderstanding your own motives. Once you comprehend the _why_ of your self-malice and the maintenance system for retaining it, you can begin to attack the behaviors.

Without the understanding of self, the old actions will continue to recur.

If you choose to not love yourself and treat yourself as unimportant by placing other heads higher than your own, you will...
- Have a built-in excuse for why you can’t get any love in your life, that is, you simply are not worth being loved back. The excuse is the neurotic payoff.
- Be able to avoid any and all risks that go with establishing love relationships with others, and thereby eliminate any possibility of ever being rejected or disapproved.
- Find that it is easier to stay the way you are. As long as you’re not worthy there is just no point in trying to grow or to be better and happier, and your payoff is remaining the same.
- Gain a lot of pity, attention and even approval from others, which substitutes nicely for the risky business of getting involved in a love relationship. Thus the pity and attention are your self-defeating rewards.
- Have many convenient scapegoats to blame for your own misery. You can complain and thus you won’t have to do anything about it yourself.
- Be able to use up your present moments with mini-depressions, and avoid behavior that would help you to be different. Your self-pity will serve as your escape route.
- Regress to being a good little boy or girl, calling upon the leftover responses of a child and therefore pleasing those “big-people” that you learned to regard as superior to you. Your regression is safer than risk.
- Be able to reinforce your leaning-on-others behavior by making them more significant than you make yourself. A leaning post is a dividend even though you’re hurt by it.
- Be unable to take charge of your own life and live it the way you choose, simply because you won’t feel that you are worth the happiness you covet.

They are the reasons you choose to hang on to the old thinking and behavior. It is just plain easier, that is, less risky, to put yourself down than to try to get up.

The only evidence for life is growth, and so to refuse to grow into a self-loving person is a deathlike choice.

### Some Easy-to-Master Self-Love Exercises

The practice of self-love begins with your mind. You must learn to control your thinking.

Requires a lot of present-moment awareness at the times when you are behaving in self-condemnatory kinds of ways.

If you can catch yourself as you are doing it, you can then begin to challenge the thought in back of your behavior.

One small step toward self-love, the step being a recognition of your present-moment put-down and a decision to act differently.

Before you had a habit; now you have an awareness of wanting to be different, and you have made a choice to make it happen.

Eventually you’ll have a new habit which will not require constant awareness.

List of such behaviors to which you can add as you achieve a sense of self-esteem based upon your own worth.
- Select new responses to others’ attempts to reach you with love or acceptance. Rather than instantly being skeptical of a loving gesture, accept them with a “thank-you” or “I’m happy that you feel that way.”
- If there is someone that you feel genuine love toward, say it right out front “I love you” and while you check out the reactions you receive in return, pat yourself on the back for taking the risk.
- In a restaurant, order something you really enjoy no matter what it costs.
Give yourself a treat because you are worth it. Begin to select items that you would prefer in all situations, including the grocery store. Indulge yourself with a favorite product because you are worth it. Outlaw self-denial unless it is absolutely necessary—and it rarely is.
- After a tiring day and a large meal take a brief nap or a jog in the park even if you have too many things to do. It will help you to feel one hundred percent better.
- Join an organization, or sign up for an activity that you will enjoy. Perhaps you’ve been putting this off because you have so many responsibilities that you just don’t have the time. By choosing to love yourself, and partaking of the slices of life that you want, those others that you serve will begin to learn some self- reliance of their own. And you will find yourself with an absence of resentment toward them. You will be serving them out of _choice,_ rather than obligation.
- Eliminate jealousy by recognizing it is a put-down of yourself. By comparing yourself to some other person and imagining you are loved less, you make others more important than you. You are measuring your own merit in comparison to another. Remind yourself that (1) Someone can always choose another without having it be a reflection on you, and (2) whether or not you are chosen by any significant other is not the way you validate your own self-worth. If you make it that way, you are doomed to eternal self-doubt, because of the uncertainty of how a particular someone out there is going to feel at any precise moment of any given day. Should he/she choose another, that choice reflects only the other, not you. With practice at self-love, any circumstances in which you’ve previously found yourself to be jealous will be reversed. You’ll believe so much in you that you won’t need the love or approval of others to give you value.
- Your self-love activity might also include new ways of treating your body, such as selecting good nutritional foods, eliminating excess weight (which can be a health risk as well as an indication of self-rejection), taking regular walks or bicycle rides, choosing plenty of healthy exercise, getting outdoors to enjoy fresh air because it feels good, and in general keeping your body healthy and attractive. Provided you want to be healthy. Why? Because you are important and are going to treat yourself that way. Any total day spent cooped up or inactive in boring routine activities is a vote for self-enmity. Unless you actually prefer being cooped-up, in which case you make that choice.
- Sexually, you can practice greater self-love. You can stand naked in front of a mirror and tell yourself how attractive you are. You can get in touch with your body... ...With others, you can also choose sexual fulfillment for you, rather than making your partner’s pleasure more important than your own. Only by choosing gratification for yourself can you give pleasure. If you aren’t happy, generally your partner is disappointed. Moreover, when you choose yourself, others are more able to choose happiness for themselves. You can slow down the whole process of sex, teaching your lover what you like with words and actions. You can choose orgasm for yourself. You can make yourself achieve the ultimate physical experience by believing that you are worth it, and then getting lost in the excitement of verifying it for you. Why? Because you are worth it!
- You can stop equating your performance in anything with your own self- worth. You may lose your job, or fail a given project. You may not like the way you performed this or that task. But that doesn’t mean that you are without worth. You must know for yourself, that you are worth something regardless of your achievements. Without this knowledge, you will be persistently confusing yourself with your external activities. It is just as absurd to make your self-value depend upon some outside accomplishment as it is to tie it in with some external person’s opinion of you. Once you eliminate this confusion, you will be able to set about all kinds of undertakings, and your final score—while it may be interesting to you—will in no way determine how valuable you are as a person.

Outlaw self-denial unless it is absolutely necessary—and it rarely is.

When you choose yourself, others are more able to choose happiness for themselves.

These... ...are the actions of those who love themselves. They... ...challenge the lessons that you’ve learned as you’ve grown- down. At one time, you were the epitome of self-love. As a child, you knew instinctively that you were worthy.

- Can you accept yourself without complaint? 
- Can you love yourself at all times?
- Can you give and receive love?
These are the issues that you can work on. Setting personal goals to be in love with the most beautiful, exciting, worthy person ever—you.

## 3 You Don’t Need Their Approval

Needing approval is tantamount to saying, “Your view of me is more important than my own opinion of myself.”

You may be spending far too many of your present moments in efforts to win the approval of others, or in being concerned with some disapproval that you have encountered.

If approval has become a _need_ in your life, then you have some work to do.

Approval-seeking is a desire rather than a necessity. 

Approval in itself is not unhealthy; in fact, adulation is deliciously pleasurable. Approval-seeking is an erroneous zone only when it becomes a need rather than a want.

If you want the approval, you are simply happy to have the endorsement of other people. But, if you need it, you are going to collapse if you don’t get it.

You feel good inside only if they decide to administer some praise to you.

The need for approval of another person is bad enough, but the real trouble comes with the need for the approval of everyone for every act.

The _need_ for approval must go! No question marks here. It must be eradicated from your life if you are to gain personal fulfillment. 

It is impossible to go through life without incurring a great deal of disapproval. It is the way of humanity, the dues you pay for your “aliveness,” something that simply cannot be avoided.

Ozzie travels in his social circles with no mind of his own, and his need for commendation is so strong that he constantly shifts his position in order to be liked. There is no Ozzie, only the happenstance reactions of others which determine not only how Ozzie feels, but also what he thinks and says as well. Ozzie is whatever others want him to be.

When approval-seeking is a need, the possibilities for truth are all but wiped away.

If you must be lauded, and you send out those kinds of signals, then no one can deal with you straight. Nor can you state with confidence what it is that you think and feel at any present moment of your life.

There can be no truth when the speaker is shifty and moves around the issues with a skillful kind of manuevering that is designed to please everyone. Behavior like this is easy to spot in politicians, but more difficult to see in ourselves.

It is tough to handle rebuking and easier to adopt behavior that will bring approval.

When you take this easy way, you’re making others’ opinions of you more important than your own self-assessments.

In order to escape... ...of approval-seeking,.. ...it is important to examine the factors that foster the approval-seeking need.

### Historical Antecedents of the Need for Approval

The need for approval is based on a single assumption. “Don’t trust yourself —check it out with someone else first.”

Our culture... ...reinforces approval-seeking behavior as a standard of life.

“Don’t swear by yourself” is the essence of the need for tribute —and the backbone of our culture.

Make someone else’s opinion more important than your own, then if you don’t get their approval, you have every reason to feel depressed, unworthy, or guilty, since they are more important than you.

The bestowal of approval can be a great manipulator. Your worth is lodged in others and if they refuse to dole out their approval, you’ve got nothing. You are without worth. And so it goes, the more flattery you need, the more you can be manipulated by others.

Any steps in the direction of self-approval and independence of the good opinion of others are movements away from their control. As a result such healthy moves get labeled as selfish, uncaring, inconsiderate and the like, in an effort to keep you dependent.

### Early Family Approval-Seeking Messages

Young children truly do need acceptance from significant adults (parents) in their formative years.

Approval should not be contingent upon being proper, nor should a child have to get a parent’s sanction for everything he says, thinks, feels, or does. Self-reliance can be taught in the crib, and approval-seeking ought not be confused with love- seeking as you read this section.

In order to encourage freedom from the need for approval in an adult, it is helpful to give the child an abundance of approval from the very beginning.

Our culture teaches a child to rely on others rather than trusting his own judgment.

“You can wear anything you like.”
“How do you like this, Mommy?”
“No, no honey! Stripes and polka dots don’t go together! Go back and change either the blouse or the slacks so that they match.”
One week later...
“What should I wear, Mommy?”
“I’ve told you, wear whatever you like. Why do you always ask me?” 
Why indeed...

At the grocery store a cashier asks the child, “Would you like a piece of candy?” The child looks at her mom. “Would I like a piece of candy?” she asks. She has learned to check out everything with her parents, including whether she wants something or not.

Rather than helping children to think for themselves, solve their own problems and develop trust in themselves, parents tend to treat children as possessions.

> Your children are not your children. They are the sons and daughters of Life’s longing for itself. They come through you but not from you, And though they are with you yet they belong not to you.
> -Kahlil Gibran, The Prophet.

Don’t trust yourself to resolve your difficulties. Mommy or Daddy will do it for you. Don’t rely on yourself to make the decisions you are capable of, check it out with someone else first.

Children resist being molded into approval-seekers.

As a child you wanted to think for yourself, to rely on yourself. If your Dad was helping you put on your coat when you were small, you said, “I can do it myself.” But too often the message in return was “I’ll do it for you. We don’t have time to wait,” or “You’re too little.”

If you don’t, we’ll disapprove and when we disapprove of you, you must disapprove of yourself.

The family unit nurtures, in the form of good intentions, dependence and the need for approval... ...Parents who don’t want any harm to come to their children resolve to protect them from danger. The result, however, is the opposite of that intended, for without the ammunition of knowing how to rely on the self in times of strife... ...it is impossible to build an arsenal of independent behavior for a lifetime.

While many of the check-it-out-with-Mommy-or-Daddy messages were important for your own safety and health, others were sent to teach you a critical concept—proper behavior, behavior that will win approval. That approval, which should have been a given, became contingent upon your pleasing someone else.

Approval... ...should be given to a child freely, not bestowed as a reward for proper conduct.

A child should never be encouraged to confuse his own self- esteem with anyone else’s approval.

### Approval-Seeking Messages from School

School... ...is designed expressly to instill approval-seeking thinking and behavior. Ask permission to do everything. Never bank on your own judgment. Ask the teacher to go to the bathroom. Sit in a particular seat... ...Everything was geared toward other-control. Instead of learning to think you were being taught not to think for yourself.

If you should incur the teacher’s, or worse yet, the principal’s wrath, you were expected to feel guilty for months.

Your report card was a message to your parents telling them how much approval you had won.

Students who are independent, full of self-love, not susceptible to guilt and worry, are systematically labeled troublemakers.

Schools are not good at dealing with kids who show signs of independent thinking. In too many schools approval-seeking is the way to success.

If you gain the acclamation of the staff, behave in the ways that they dictate, study the curriculum that is laid out in front of you, you’ll emerge successful. Albeit with a strong _need_ for approval, since self-reliance has been discouraged at virtually every turn.

By the time a student reaches intermediate school he has usually learned the approval lesson... ...In the classroom he’ll learn not to question what he is told.

If he doesn’t learn these things he’ll be punished with low grades—and the teacher’s disapproval.

He covets approval, and learns that gaining the sanction of others is tantamount to being successful and happy.

At college the same pattern of indoctrination continues... ...Conform, please your professors and you’ll make it.

When a student finally gets into a seminar where the professor says: “This semester you can study whatever you want in your field of interest... ...Panic sets in. “But how many papers do we have to do?”, “When are they due?”... ...“Do I have to come to class every day?” These are the questions of an approval-seeker and it’s not the least bit surprising in view of the educational methods we’ve examined.

The student... ...queries are the end product of a system that demands approval-seeking for survival. He is terrified of thinking for himself.

### Approval-Seeking Messages from other Institutions

We acquire approval-seeking symptoms from other sources... ...the church... ...please Jehovah, or Jesus... ...using fear of retribution as a weapon... ...a man behaves morally not because he believes it to be appropriate for him, but because God wants him to behave that way.

Behave because someone has told you to and because you will be punished if you don’t, not because you know it to be the right behavior for you.

It may produce the same behavior that you would have chosen, but you haven’t chosen it freely.

Using yourself as a guide and not needing the approval of an outside force is the most religious experience you can have.

It is a veritable religion of the self in which an individual determines his own behavior based upon his own conscience and the laws of his culture that work for him, rather than because someone has dictated how he _should_ behave.

The government... ...“Don’t trust yourself. You haven’t got the skills and wherewithal to function alone. We’ll take care of you.

"You don’t have to think for yourself, we’ll regulate your life for you."

There are more rules on the books than there are people to disobey them.

If someone decided to enforce every rule that exists, you would find yourself in violation of the law hundreds of times a day.

There are rules against everything, including what you can wear at a given time in a given place, how you can enjoy sex, what you can say, and where you can walk.

The songs that we hear each day are filled with lyrical messages of approval-seeking... ...Here is a brief list...
• “I can’t live, if living is without you.”
• “You make me so very happy.”
• “You make me feel like a natural woman.”
• “You’re nobody till somebody cares.”
• “It all depends on you.”
• “You make me feel brand new.”
• “No one else can make me feel the colors that you bring.” 
• “Without you, I’m nothing.”

Next time... ...Check for those lyrics... ...Rewrite the songs...
• I make myself feel like a natural woman; it has nothing to do with you.
• I chose to love you. I must have wanted to do it then, but now I’ve changed my mind.
• People who _need_ people are the unluckiest people in the world. But people who _want love_ and _enjoy_ people are making themselves happy.
• I make myself so very happy because of the things I tell myself about you. • I am the sunshine of my life, and having you in it makes it even brighter.
• I can stop loving you, but at this point I choose not to.

“Without me I’m nothing, but having you makes this present moment very nice.”

Television commercials... ...are efforts by the manufacturer to manipulate you into buying their products, by reinforcing the notion that other peoples’ beliefs are more important than your own.

A woman shrinks in fear as she contemplates how her friends will view her if she has baggy pantyhose. “I just couldn’t stand it if they thought something bad about me. I must have their approval, so I’ll buy this brand over that one.”

Advertisements are filled with psychological messages that you must have approval... ...Because they work! They sell.

It is hardly surprising that... ...You’ve been conditioned... ...throughout your life.

> “Habit is habit, and not to be flung out of the window by any man, but coaxed downstairs a step at a time.”
> -Mark Twain, Puddinhead Wilson’s Calendar
 
### Coaxing Approval-Seeking Downstairs, A Step at a Time

Take a look at the way the world works... ...you can never please everyone.

If you please fifty percent of the people you are doing quite well. This is no secret.

At least half of the people in your world are going to disagree with at least half the things you say.
 
You will always have about a 50-50 chance of getting some disapproval whenever you express an opinion.

Begin to look at disapproval in a new light. When someone disapproves of something you say, instead of being hurt, or instantly shifting your opinion to gain praise, you can remind yourself that you’ve just run into one of those folks in the fifty percent who don’t agree with you.

Knowing that you’ll always get some disapproval for everything you feel, think, say or do is the way out of the tunnel of despair.

Once you expect it... ...you’ll stop equating the repudiation of an idea or a feeling with the repudiation of you.

You can never escape disapproval, no matter how much you may want it to go away. For every opinion you have, there is a counterpart out there with exactly the opposite view.

> ...If I were to read, much less to answer all the attacks made on me, this shop might as well be closed for any other business. I do the very best I know how—the very best I can; and I mean to keep doing so until the end. If the end brings me out alright, what is said against me won’t amount to anything. If the end brings me out wrong, ten angels swearing I was right
would make no difference.
> —Abraham Lincoln, a conversation at the White House reported by Francis B. Carpenter.

### Some Examples of Typical Approval-Seeking Behavior

Like self-rejection, approval-seeking encompasses a large category of self- defeating behaviors.

- Changing a position, or altering what you believe because someone shows signs of disapproval.
- Sugar-coating a statement to avoid the reaction of displeasure.
- Apple-polishing in order to make someone like you.
- Feeling depressed or anxious when someone disagrees with you.
- Feeling insulted or put-down when someone states a contrary sentiment to
your own.
- Labeling someone a snob, or “stuck-up,” which is just another way of
saying “Pay more attention to me.”
- Being excessively agreeable and head nodding, even when you don’t agree
at all with what is being said.
- Eating a steak in a restaurant that is not cooked the way you ordered it,
  because the waiter won’t like you if you send it back.
- Apologizing for yourself at every turn—the excessive “I’m sorry’s” that
are designed to have others forgive you, and approve of you all of the time.
- Behaving in _nonconforming_ ways for the purpose of gaining attention, which is the same neurosis as conforming for the sake of external approval. Thus, wearing tennis shoes with your tuxedo, or eating a handful of mashed potatoes and wanting to be noticed is still approval-seeking.
- Being pathologically late for all occasions. Here you can’t help but be seen and it is an approval-seeking device which gets everyone to pay attention. You may be doing it out of a need to be distinguished, and hence you are controlled by those doing the noticing.
- Trying to impress others with your knowledge of something that you know nothing about by “faking it.”
- Begging for compliments by setting yourself up for approval, and then feeling bad when they don’t come.
- Being unhappy about someone you respect having a contrary point of view, and expressing it to you.

Approval-seeking... ...is only distasteful when it becomes a need, which, of course, is tantamount to giving up the self, and placing responsibility for how you feel in the hands of others whose approbation is being sought.

### The Dividends for Approval-Seeking

A look at the why of this self-defeating behavior will be useful in coming up with some strategies for eliminating approval-seeking needs.

Payoffs for approval-seeking as a need include:

- Placing RESPONSIBILITY for your feelings on others. If you feel the way you do (lousy, hurt, depressed, etc.) because someone else didn’t approve of you, then THEY, not you, are responsible for how you feel.
- If they are responsible for how you feel because of with-holding their approval, then any CHANGE in you is also impossible, since it is their fault that you feel the way you do. Then they are also responsible for keeping you from being different. Thus approval-seeking helps you to avoid changing.
- As long as they are responsible and you can’t change, you don’t have to take any risks. Consequently, hanging onto approval-seeking as a way of life will help you to conveniently avoid any risk-taking activities in your life.
- Reinforcing a poor self-image and therefore encouraging self-pity and do- nothingism. If you are immune from the need for approval, you are immune
from self-pity when you don’t get it.
- Reinforcing the idea that others must take care of you, and therefore you
can revert to the child in you and be coddled, protected—and manipulated.
- Blaming others for what you are feeling, thereby creating a scapegoating
effect for everything you don’t like in your life.
- Deluding yourself that you are liked by those others you’ve made more
important than yourself and thus feeling outwardly comfortable even though there is a cauldron of discontent seething inside of you. As long as the others are more significant, then the outward appearance is more important.
- Taking solace in the fact that others notice you, which gives you something to boast about to other approval-seeking friends.
- Fitting into the culture which applauds such behavior and winning you the favor of the many.

Approval-seeking helps you to avoid changing.

The theme of avoiding responsibility, change and risk is at the heart of all the self-destructive thinking and behavior.

It is just plain easier, more familiar and less risky to hang onto neurotic behaviors. Approval-seeking as a need is obviously no exception.

### A Look at the Supreme Irony of Approval-Seeking Behavior

For a moment... ...Assume that you really wanted approval from everyone and that it was possible to obtain it... ...with this in mind... ...What is this individual like? How does he behave? What is it about him that attracts everyone? You probably have someone in mind who is candid, direct and straightforward, independent of other people’s opinions, and fulfilled. He probably has little or no time for approval-seeking. This is very likely a person who will tell it like it is, despite the consequences. Perhaps he finds tact and diplomacy less important than honesty. He is not a hurtful person, just an individual who has little time for the game-playing that goes with speaking delicately and being careful to say it just right to avoid hurting feelings. Isn’t that ironic! The people who seem to get the most approval in life are those who never seek it out, who have no desire for it, and who are not preoccupied with achieving it.

Happiness is an absence of approval-seeking as a need.

> A big cat saw a little cat chasing its tail and asked, “Why are you chasing your tail so?” Said the kitten, “I have learned that the best thing for a cat is happiness, and that happiness is my tail. Therefore, I am chasing it: and when I catch it, I shall have happiness.”
Said the old cat, “My son, I, too, have paid attention to the problems of the universe. I, too, have judged that happiness is in my tail. But, I have noticed that whenever I chase after it, it keeps running away from me, and when I
go about my business, it just seems to come after me wherever I go.”
> —C. L. James, “On Happiness,” in To See a World in a Grain of Sand, by Caesar Johnson (Norwalk, Conn.: The C. R. Gibson Co., 1972).
 
If you want all of that approval, it is ironic that the most effective way to get it is to not want it and to avoid chasing after it and to not demand it from everyone.

By being in touch with yourself and using your positive self-image as a consultant, much more approval will come to you.

Of course you will never get approval from everyone for everything that you do, but when you see yourself as worthy you’ll never be depressed when approval is withheld.

Disapproval... ...natural consequence of living on this planet where people are individual in their perceptions.

### Some Specific Strategies for Eliminating Approval-Seeking as a Need

To cut down on your own approval-seeking behavior, you will need to come in touch with your own neurotic rewards for the continuation of the behavior.

Beyond just thinking new self-enhancing thoughts when you contact disapproval... ...here are some specific things you can work on to get yourself out of the approval-seeking bind.

• Label disapproval with new responses that begin with the word _you._ For example, you note that your father is not agreeing with you and is even getting angry. Rather than shifting or defending yourself, simply respond with, “You’re getting upset, and you feel that I shouldn’t think the way I do.” This will keep you in touch with the fact that disapproval belongs to him, not you. The you strategy can be employed any time, and with amazing results if you master the technique. You’ll have to fight your temptation to start with “I,” thereby putting yourself in the position of defending or modifying what you just said in order to gain acceptance.
• If you think someone else is trying to manipulate you by withholding approval, say so. Instead of turning wishy-washy for the purpose of reaping some approval benefits, you can say out loud, “Generally I would shift my position now in order to get you to like me, but I really believe in what I said, and you’ll have to deal with your own feelings about it.” Or, “I guess you’d like me to change what I just said.” The act of labeling it will be helpful in keeping in touch with your own thinking and behavior.
• You can thank someone for providing you with data that will be helpful in your growth, even though it was something you didn’t like. The act of thanking puts an end to any approval-seeking.
• You can actively seek disapproval and work on yourself to not be upset. Select someone who is bound to disagree and, flying in the face of the disapproval, maintain your position calmly...  ...By going after disapproval, rather than avoiding it, you’ll build up your repertoire of behavior for dealing effectively with it.
• You can practice ignoring disapproval and not paying any attention to those who attempt to manipulate you with their denunciation... ...By ignoring the abuse, he proved that he wasn’t going to evaluate himself on the basis of what someone else felt.
• You can break the connecting chain between what others think, say and do, and your own self-worth. Talk to yourself when you encounter disapproval.
“This is her stuff. I expect her to behave that way. It has nothing to do with me.” This approach will eliminate the self-hurt that you inflict when you connect someone else’s feeling with your own thoughts.
• Ask yourself this important question when you acquire disapproval. If they agreed with me, would I be better off? The answer is obviously no. Whatever they think can have no effect on you unless you let it. Moreover, you’ll most likely find that you are better liked by those important folks like a boss, or loved one when you can disagree with them without worry.
• Accept the simple fact that many won’t ever understand you, and that it is okay. Conversely, you won’t understand many people who are very close to you. You don’t have to. It’s all right for them to be different and the most fundamental understanding you can have is that you don’t understand.
• You can refuse to argue or try to convince anyone of the rightness of your stance, and simply believe it.
• Trust yourself when buying clothes or other personal items without first checking it out with someone whose opinion you value more than your own.
• Stop verifying your facts by having them substantiated by someone else
• Correct yourself out loud whenever you’ve behaved in an approval-seeking way, thereby becoming aware of this tendency and practicing new behaviors.
• Work at eliminating the numerous apologies that you make even when you aren’t really sorry for what you’ve just said. All apologies are pleas for forgiveness, and requests for forgiveness are approval-seeking... ...While you can resolve not to behave in certain ways again, and see some of your behavior as unfortunate, apologizing behavior is a sickness that invests control of one’s feelings in another.
• In a conversation, you can clock the amount of time that you speak and compare it with the amount spoken by your partner and acquaintances. You can work at not being the one who speaks infrequently and only when asked to participate.
• You can observe at your next get-together how many more times you are interrupted, and whether you always condescend when you speak simultaneously with another member of the group. Your approval-seeking may be taking the form of timidity. You can devise strategies for speaking without being interrupted by labeling the behavior as it crops up in your social milieu.
• Chronicle how many declarative versus interrogative sentences you make. Do you ask questions, seek permission and approval, as opposed to making a statement? For example, the question, “Nice day, isn’t it?” puts the other person into the problem-solving role, and you into the approval-seeking position. A simple, “Nice day” is a declaration, rather than an attempt to seek an answer. If you are always asking questions of others you are into approval-seeking in what may seem a petty area, but which is reflective of your lack of confidence in your own ability to take charge.

The act of thanking puts an end to any approval-seeking.

You’ll most likely find that you are better liked by those important folks like a boss, or loved one when you can disagree with them without worry.

>....If people who do not understand each other at least understand that they do not understand each other, then they understand each other better than when, not understanding each other, they do not even understand that they do not understand each other.
> —Gustav Ischheiser, Appearances and Realities.

Work at not being the one who speaks infrequently and only when asked to participate.

While you are not striving to wipe out all approval, you are working toward not being immobilized in any small way because you don’t get the blandishments you covet.

Just as the dieter does not test his mettle for losing weight on a full stomach, or the individual who is quitting smoking doesn’t measure his resolve after just putting out a cigarette, you won’t really test yourself in the absence of disapproval.

Until you are faced with the circumstances of contention you won’t know how you are doing.

If you can eliminate this troublesome erroneous zone from your life, the rest will seem easy, because you have been conditioned to need approval from your first breath on this earth.

It will require a great deal of practice, but it is worth every bit of effort you put into it. Immunity from despair in the face of disapproval is the ticket to a lifetime of delectable personal present-moment freedom.

## 4 Breaking Free From the Past

Only a ghost wallows around in his past, explaining himself with self- descriptors based on a life lived through. You are what you choose today, not what you’ve chosen before.

Who are you? How do you describe yourself? To answer these two questions, you will very likely have to refer to your own history, to a past that has been lived through, but to which you are undoubtedly tied, and from which you find it difficult to escape.

Self-descriptors are not in themselves inappropriate, but they can be used in harmful ways. The very act of labeling might be a specific deterrent to growth. It’s easy to use the label as justification for remaining the same.

Sören Kierkegaard wrote, “Once you label me, you negate me.”

> “Once you label me, you negate me.”
> —Sören Kierkegaard

You could be negating yourself by identifying with your trademarks, rather than your own potential for growth.

All self-labels come out of an individual’s history. But the past, as Carl Sandburg said in _Prairie,_ “is a bucket of ashes.”

All self-defeating “I’ms” are the result of the use of these four neurotic sentences:
(1)“That’s me.”
(2) “I’ve always been that way.” 
(3) “I can’t help it.”
(4)“That’s my nature.”

“Oh, I’ve always been that way.” Why? Because “That’s just the way I am.”... ...rationale... ...which comes from a past of always having behaved in that manner.

You might ask someone why he always gets upset when the subject of accidents arises and he is likely to respond, “Oh, that’s just me, I’ve always been that way. I really can’t help it, it’s just my nature.” Whew! All four at once, and each being used as an explanation for why he will never be different and never even consider changing.

Every time you use one of these four sentences you are really saying, “And I intend to continue being the way I’ve always been.”

Here is a typical list of “I’ms” that may be included in your own self-portrait: I’m Shy, I’m a Lousy Cook, I’m Fat, I’m Lazy, I’m a Poor Speller, I’m Not Musical, I’m Not Athletic.

The point is not which labels you choose, but that you choose to label yourself at all.

### How Those “I’ms” Got Started

The antecedents to your I’ms fall into two categories. The first kind of labels come from other people. They were pinned on you as a child and you carry them around with you to this day. The other labels are the result of a choice you made to keep from having to do uncomfortable or difficult chores.

Most I’ms are leftovers, hangers-on from a time when you heard such sentences as: “He’s kind of clumsy; his brother is good at athletics, but he’s the studious one.”... ...Or, “Billy was always the shy one.” Or, “She’s just like her father; he couldn’t carry a tune with a wheelbarrow.”

I’ms that never get challenged. They are simply accepted as a condition of life.

Have a conversation with the people in your life who you feel are most responsible for many of your I’ms... ...Ask them how they think you got to be the way you are and if you’ve always been that way. Tell them you are determined to change... ...You’ll be surprised at their own interpretations and how they feel you can’t be any different, since “You’ve always been that way.”

The second category of I’ms originates in those convenient tags that you’ve learned to place on yourself in order to avoid distasteful activities.

He avoids having to fix the doorbell, or the radio, or any unpleasant handyman activity by simply reminding his wife, “Now you know, dear, I’m just not mechanical.”

These kinds of I’ms are adaptive behaviors, but they are nevertheless delusional excuses.

In these cases, the individuals are saying something about themselves. They are stating, “I am a finished product in this area, and I am never going to be any different.”

If you are a finished product, all tied up and put away, you have stopped growing, and while you may very well want to hang onto some I’ms you may find that others are simply limiting and self-destructive.

To stay exactly the way you are in any area is to make one of those deathlike decisions described in Chapter I.

This is not a discussion of the things that you just plain don’t enjoy, but rather a look at behavior that keeps you from activities from which you might choose a great deal of pleasure and excitement.

### Ten Typical “I’m” Categories and Their Neurotic Dividends

1. _I’m poor at math, spelling, reading, languages, etc._ This I’m guarantees that you won’t put in the effort required to change... ...As long as you label yourself inept, you have a built-in reason to avoid tackling it.
2. _I’m lousy at some skill areas such as cooking, sports, crocheting, drawing, acting, etc._ This I’m assures that you won’t have to do any of these things in the future and justifies any poor performance in the past... ...it helps you to hang onto the absurd notion that you shouldn’t do anything if you don’t do it really well. Thus, unless you’re the world champion, avoidance is better than doing.
3. _I’m shy, reserved, temperamental, nervous, afraid, etc._
The call is to genetics for these I’ms. Rather than challenging them and the self-destructive thinking which supports them, you simply accept them as a confirmation of the way you’ve always been... ...You choose this behavior as a way to avoid being assertive in situations which have always been troublesome for you... ...These are the personality I’ms. These self-definitions help you to avoid the tough business of being different from what you’ve always been... ...You simply define your personality with a convenient I’m and you can now excuse all kinds of self-forfeiting behaviors as out of your control.
4. _I’m clumsy, uncoordinated, etc._ These I’ms that you learned as a child enable you to avoid potential ridicule that might come your way because you aren’t as physically skilled as others... ...Of course, your lack of skill comes from a history of believing those I’ms and hence avoiding physical activity, rather than from some inherent defect... ...You get good at what you practice, not what you shun.
5. _I’m unattractive, ugly, big-boned, plain, too tall, etc._ These physiological I’ms are helpful in keeping you from taking risks with the opposite sex, and in justifying the poor self-image and lack of love you’ve chosen for yourself... ...And you don’t have to work at looking attractive to yourself, as well. You use your mirror as justification for not taking a chance... ...we see exactly what we choose to—even in mirrors.
6. _I’m unorganized, meticulous, sloppy, etc._ These behavioral I’ms are convenient for manipulating others and in justifying why things have to be done a certain way. I’ve always done it that way. As if tradition were a reason to do anything. And I’ll always do it that way is the unstated message... ...This is the I’m that calls upon “policy” as a substitute for thinking.
7. _I’m forgetful, careless, irresponsible, apathetic, etc._ These kinds of I’ms are especially useful to you when you want to vindicate yourself for some ineffective behavior. The I’m keeps you from ever going to work on your memory, or your carelessness, and you simply excuse yourself with your neat little, “That’s me.”... ...Just go on forgetting and reminding yourself that you can’t really help it, and you’ll always be forgetful.
8. _I’m Italian, German, Jewish, Irish, Black, Chinese, etc._ These are your ethnic I’ms, and they work very well when you run out of other reasons to explain some behaviors that you have, which don’t work for you, but are just too damned difficult to tackle.
9. _I’m bossy, pushy, authoritarian, etc._ Here your I’m can allow you to continue hostile acts, rather than work at developing self-discipline.
10. _I’m old, middle-aged, tired, etc._ With this I’m you can use your age as a reason for not participating in what might be risky or threatening activities... ...The implication of an “age-I’m” is that you are absolutely finished in this area, and since you will always get older, you are finished growing and experiencing anything new.

### The “I’m” Circle

The rewards for hanging onto your past by trotting out your I’ms can be neatly summed up in the one word: avoidance.

After you use these labels enough, you begin to believe them yourself, and at that present moment you are a finished product destined to remain as you are for the rest of your days.

Labels enable you to avoid the hard work and the risk of trying to change. They perpetuate the behavior which has given rise to them.

![The I'm circle](./the-im-circle.jpg)

Whatever the reasons for his fear he has decided not to go to work on his social-wariness, but to explain it away with a simple I’m. His fear of failing is strong enough to prevent him from trying.

Were he to believe in the present moment and his ability to make a choice, his sentence would change from, “I’m shy,” to “Up until now, I’ve behaved in a shy manner.”

![The I'm circle updated](./the-im-circle-updated.jpg)

Those infernal I’ms are the things that you call upon to exonerate yourself and to explain to others why you persist in a self-defeating pattern.

The number one payoff for hanging onto your past and resting on your I’ms is avoidance of change.

Every time you use an I’m to explain a behavior that you don’t like, think of yourself in that gaily decorated box, all wrapped up as a finished package.

A neat little payoff indeed, and one that provides you with a warranty against any risk-taking. If it’s the “culture’s” fault that you have this I’m, you can’t do anything about it.

### Some Strategies for Freeing Yourself from the Past and Eliminating Your Vexing I’ms

Leaving the past behind involves taking risks.

You have become accustomed to your self-definitions.

Strategies for eliminating those I’ms include:
- Eliminating I’m wherever you can. Substitute with such sentences as, “Until today I’ve chose to be that way,” or “I used to label myself...”
- Announce to those close to you that you are going to work at eliminating some of your I’ms... ...ask them to remind you whenever you haul them out.
- Set behavioral goals to act differently than you’ve ever done before. For example, if you consider yourself shy, introduce yourself to one person who you might otherwise have avoided.
- Talk with a trusted confidant who will help you combat the powers of the past. Ask him to signal you silently with a tug to his ear each time he notices you falling back into your I’m.
- Keep a journal on your self-destructive I’m behavior, and record your action as well as how you were feeling about yourself while you were behaving that way. For one week record in a notebook the exact time, date and occasion when you used any of the self-destructive I’ms, and work at diminishing the entries. Use the list provided earlier in this chapter as a guide to your journal- keeping.
- Watch out for the four neurotic sentences and whenever you fall into using them, correct yourself out loud in the following way. Change: 
“That’s me.”...to...“That was me.”
“I can’t help it.”...to...“I can change that if I work on it.”
“I’ve always been that way.”...to...“I’m going to be different.”
“That’s my nature.”...to...“That’s what I used to believe was my nature.”
- Try to work each day on eliminating one I’m just for that day.
- You can interrupt your own “I’m-Circle” between point 3 and 4, and resolve to toss out those ancient excuses for avoidance.
- Find something you’ve never done and set aside an afternoon for that activity. After your three-hour immersion in a totally new activity, one that you’ve always avoided in the past, see if you can still use the same I’m that you applied that morning.

All of your I’ms are learned avoidance patterns, and you can learn to be almost anything if you make the choice to do so.

### Some Final Thoughts

There is no such thing as human nature. The phrase itself is designed to pigeonhole people and to create excuses.

You are the sum product of your choices, and every I’m you treasure could be relabeled, “I’ve chosen to be.”

> “The best thing for being sad,” replied Merlin, beginning to puff and blow, “is to learn something. That is the only thing that never fails. You may grow old and trembling in your anatomies, you may lie awake at night listening to the disorder of your veins, you may miss your only love, you may see the world about you devastated by evil lunatics, or know your honor trampled in the sewers of baser minds. There is only one thing for it then—to learn. Learn why the world wags and what wags it. That is the only thing which the mind can never exhaust, never alienate, never be tortured by, never fear or distrust, and never dream of regretting. Learning is the thing for you. Look at what a lot of things there are to learn—pure science, the only purity there is. You can learn astronomy in a lifetime, natural history in three, literature in six. And then, after you have exhausted a million lifetimes in biology and medicine and theocriticism and geography and history and economics, why, you can start to make a cartwheel out of the appropriate wood, or spend fifty years learning to begin to learn to beat your adversary at fencing. After that you can start again on mathematics until it is time to learn to plough.”
> -Merlin character in Terence H. White, The Once and Future King  

## 5 The Useless Emotions — Guilt and Worry

If you believe that feeling bad or worrying long enough will change a past or future event, then you are residing on another planet with a different reality system.

Throughout life, the two most futile emotions are guilt for what has been done and worry about what might be done.

As you examine these two erroneous zones, you will begin to see how connected they are; in fact they can be viewed as opposite ends of the same zone.

![Guilt and worry in time](./guilt-and-worry-in-time.jpg)

_Guilt_ means that you use up your present moments being immobilized as a result of _past_ behavior, while _worry_ is the contrivance that keeps you immobilized in the now about something in the _future_

if you try to think of yourself as feeling guilty about an event that has yet to occur, or to worry about something that has happened. Although one response is to the future and the other to the past, they both serve the identical purpose of keeping you upset or immobile in your present moment.

> It isn’t the experience of today that drives men mad. It is the remorse for something that happened yesterday, and the dread of what tomorrow may disclose.
> -Robert Jones Burdette, Golden Day

The world is populated with folks who are either feeling horrible about something that they shouldn’t have done or dismayed about things that might or might not happen. You are probably no exception.

Guilt and worry are perhaps the most common forms of distress in our culture.

With guilt you focus on a past event... ...and use up your present moments being occupied with feelings over the past behavior.

With worry, you use up those valuable nows, obsessing about a future event.

Whether you’re looking backward or forward, the result is the same. You’re throwing away the present moment.

> There are two days in the week about which and upon which I never worry. Two carefree days, kept sacredly free from fear and apprehension. One of these days is yesterday...and the other day I do not worry about is tomorrow.
> -Robert Jones Burdette, Golden Day

### A Closer Look at Guilt

Many of us have been subjected to a conspiracy of guilt in our lifetimes... ...to turn us into veritable guilt machines. The machine works like this. Someone sends out a message designed to remind you that you’ve been a bad person because of something you said or didn’t say, felt or didn’t feel, did or didn’t do. You respond by feeling bad in your present moment. You are the guilt machine... ...that responds with guilt whenever the appropriate fuel is poured into you. And you are well oiled if you’ve had a total immersion into our guilt-producing culture.

It is considered “bad” if you don’t feel guilty, and “inhuman” not to worry. It all has to do with CARING. If you really care about anyone, or anything, then you show this concern by feeling guilty about the terrible things you’ve done, or by giving some visible evidence that you are concerned about their future.

You have to demonstrate your neurosis in order to be labeled a caring person.

Guilt is the most useless of all erroneous zone behaviors. It is by far the greatest waste of emotional energy... ...you are feeling immobilized in the present over something that has _already_ taken place, and no amount of guilt can ever change history.

#### Distinguishing Guilt from Learning From your Past

Guilt is not merely a concern with the past; it is a present-moment immobilization about a past event. And the degree of immobilization can run from mild upset to severe depression.

If you are simply learning from your past, and vowing to avoid the repetition of some specific behavior, this is not guilt.

Learning from your mistakes is healthy and a necessary part of growth.

No amount of guilt can ever undo anything.

### The Origins of Guilt

Two basic ways in which guilt becomes a part of the emotional makeup of an individual. In the first, guilt is learned at a very early age and remains with a grown-up as a leftover childish response. In the second case, guilt is self-imposed by an adult for an infraction of a code to which he professes to subscribe.

1. _Leftover Guilt._ This guilt is the emotional reaction which is carried around from childhood memories. There are scores of these guilt producers, and while they work in that they produce results in children, people still tote around these sentences as adults.

As an adult... ...these... ...can still produce hurt if a person disappoints... ...others whom he has made into parents. The persistent attempt to win their support is there, and so is the guilt when the efforts are unsuccessful.

These guilt reactions are present as a result of learning to be manipulated by adults in childhood, but they can still operate when the child has grown up.

2. _Self-imposed Guilt._ This second category of guilt reactions is a much more troublesome area. Here the individual is being immobilized by things he has done recently, but which are not necessarily tied to being a child. This is the guilt imposed on the self when an adult rule or moral code is broken.

The individual may feel bad for a long time even though the hurting can do nothing to change what has happened.

You can look at all of your guilt either as reactions to leftover imposed standards in which you are still trying to please an absent authority figure, or as the result of trying to live up to self-imposed standards which you really don’t buy, but for some reason pay lip service to. In either case, it is stupid, and, more important, useless behavior.

Your guilt is an attempt to change history, to wish that it weren’t so. But history is so and you can’t do anything about it.

While the restraining messages are omnipresent in our culture, guilt about enjoying yourself is purely self-inflicted.

You can learn to savor pleasure without a sense of guilt. You can learn to see yourself as someone who is capable of doing anything that fits into your own value system and does not harm others—and doing it without guilt.

If you do something... ...and you don’t like it or yourself after having done it, you can vow to eliminate such behavior for yourself in the future.

The guilt... ...not only keeps you immobilized, but it actually intensifies the chances that you’ll repeat the unwanted behavior.

As long as you retain the potential payoff of absolving yourself with guilt, you’ll be able to keep yourself in that vicious treadmill that leads to nothing but present-moment unhappiness.

### Typical Guilt-Producing Categories and Reactions

Parental guilt on children of all ages. Manipulating the child to complete a task through guilt.

A parent can recall all of the hard times in which he gave up his happiness so that you might have something.

Guilt is an effective method for parental manipulation of a child’s actions.

Parental illness is a super guilt manufacturer. “You’ve made my blood pressure go up.” References to “killing me” or “giving me a heart attack” are effective guilt prodders, as well as blaming you for virtually all of the normal ailments associated with growing older.

You need big shoulders to carry this guilt around, since it can literally last a lifetime, and if you are particularly vulnerable, you can even carry the guilt of a parent’s death.

Sexual guilt imposed by parents is quite common. All sexual thought or behavior is fertile soil for the cultivation of guilt.

A child can be helped to learn socially acceptable behavior without the accompanying guilt. A simple reminder which follows an explanation of why the behavior is undesirable is much more effective.

Reaching adulthood does not put an end to parental manipulation by guilt.

Parental-and family-associated guilt is the most common strategy for keeping a rebellious person in tow... ...helping a son/daughter to choose guilt (present-moment immobility over a past event) as the price of genealogy.

### Lover- and Spouse-Related Guilt

The “If you loved me” guilt is one way to manipulate a lover.

Whenever one person doesn’t measure up, guilt can be used to get him back into the fold. He must feel guilty for not having loved the other.

Grudges, long silences and hurtful looks are useful methods of engendering guilt... ...This is a commonly employed tactic in the case of straying behavior on the part of one partner.

Often, years after an incident, an action is recalled to help the other person to choose present-moment guilt.

Guilt is useful in making a love partner conform to the other’s demands and standards of behavior.

The goal? Getting one partner to do what the other wants him to. The method? Guilt.

### Children-Inspired Guilt

The parental guilt game can be reversed. Guilt can be a two-way street and children are just as apt to use it in manipulating their parents as the reverse.

If a child realizes that his parent cannot cope with his being unhappy and will feel guilty for being a bad parent, the child will often try to use that guilt to manipulate the parent.

“You don’t love me. If you did you wouldn’t treat me this way.” And the ultimate, “I must be adopted. My real parents wouldn’t treat me like this.” All these statements carry the same message. You as a parent ought to feel guilty for treating me, your child, in this way.

Children learn this guilt-producing behavior by watching the adults in their world use them to get the things that they want.

Guilt is not a natural behavior. It is a learned emotional response that can only be used if the victim teaches the exploiter that he is vulnerable.

If your children use these tactics, they picked them up somewhere. Very likely, from you.

### School-Inspired Guilt

Teachers are superlative guilt originators, and children... ...are excellent subjects for manipulation.

“Your mother is really going to be disappointed in you.”
“You should be ashamed of yourself for getting a C—a smart boy like you.”

Guilt is often used in schools to make children learn certain things or behave in certain ways. 

As an adult you are a product of those schools.

### Church-Related Guilt

Religion is often used to produce guilt and therefore manipulate behavior. Here God is generally the one you have let down. In some cases the message is that you will be kept out of heaven for having behaved badly.

“If you loved God, you wouldn’t behave that way.”
“You won’t get into heaven unless you repent for your sins.”

### Other Institutional Guilt Producers

Most prisons operate on the guilt theory. That is, if a person sits long enough thinking how bad he’s been, he will be better for the guilt.

Sit in a jail and feel bad for what you’ve done. This policy is so expensive and useless that it defies logical explanation. The illogical explanation, of course, is that _guilt_ is such an integral part of our culture, that it is the backbone of our criminal justice system.

Rather than have civil law breakers help society or repay their debts, they are reformed through guilt-producing incarceration that has no benefit to anyone, least of all the offender.

No amount of guilt, however large, will change past behavior.

In our society tipping is a practice that has come to reflect not superior service but the guilt of the person served. Effective waiters and waitresses, cab drivers, bell boys, and other serving employees have learned that most people cannot handle guilt for not behaving in the correct way and will tip the standard percentage regardless of the quality of service received.

Littering, smoking and other unacceptable behavior may be things that you can be made to feel guilty about... ...Instead of feeling guilty about something you have already done, why not simply resolve not to behave in an antisocial manner again.

Dieting is an area that is loaded with guilt... ...If you are striving to lose weight and give in to counterproductive behavior, you can learn from it and work at being more effective in your present moment.

To feel guilty and full of self-reproach is a waste of time, for, if you feel that way for very long, you are likely to repeat... ...as your own neurotic way out of your dilemma.

### Sexual Expression Guilt

Perhaps the area where guilt flourishes best in our society is in the realm of sex. We have already seen how parents engender guilt in children for sexual acts or thoughts... ...Some people can’t admit to enjoying oral sex and often feel guilty for even thinking about it.

If I had to locate a guilt center in the body, I would place it in the crotch.

Keep in mind that whatever the dividend, it is bound to be self-defeating, and remember that the next time you opt for guilt over freedom.

### The Psychological Payoffs for Choosing Guilt

Basic reasons for choosing to waste your present feeling guilty about things that you’ve done or failed to do in the past:
• By absorbing your present moments feeling guilty about something that has already taken place, you don’t have to use that now moment in any kind of effective, self-enhancing way... ...like so many self-defeating behaviors, guilt is an avoidance technique for working on yourself in the present. Thus you shift responsibility for what you are or are not now to what you were or were not in the past.
• By shifting responsibility backward you not only avoid the hard work of changing yourself now but the attendant risks that go with change as well. It is easier to immobilize yourself with guilt about the past than to take the hazardous path of growing in the present.
• There is a tendency to believe that if you feel guilty enough, you will eventually be exonerated for having been naughty. This being forgiven payoff is the basis of the prison mentality described above, in which the inmate pays for sins by feeling terrible for a long period of time. The greater the transgression, the longer the period of remorse necessary for pardon.
• Guilt can be a means of returning to the safety of childhood, a secure period when others made decisions for you and took care of you. Rather than taking yourself in hand in the present, you rely on the values of others from your past. And once again the payoff is in being protected from having to take charge of your own life.
• Guilt is a useful method for transferring responsibility for your behavior
from yourself to others. It is easy to get infuriated at how you are being manipulated and to shift the focus for your guilt off yourself, and onto those infernal others, who are so powerful that they can make you feel anything they want, including guilt.
• Often you can win the approval of others even when those others don’t approve of your behavior by feeling guilt for that behavior. You may have done something out of line, but by feeling guilty you are showing that you know the proper way to behave, and are making an attempt to fit in.
• Guilt is a superb way to win pity from others. No matter that the desire for the pity is a clear indication of low self-esteem. In this case you’d rather have others feel sorry for you, than like and respect yourself.

Guilt, like all self-nullifying emotions, is a choice, something that you exercise control over.

### Some Strategies for Eliminating Guilt

• Begin to view the past as something that can never be changed, despite how you feel about it... ...Emblazon this sentence on your consciousness. “My feeling guilty will not change the past, nor will it make me a better person.” This sort of thinking will help you to differentiate guilt from learning as a result of your past.
• Ask yourself what you are avoiding in the present with guilt about the past. By going to work on that particular thing, you will eliminate the need for guilt.
• Begin to accept certain things about yourself that you’ve chosen but which others may dislike... ...Remember what was said earlier about approval seeking. It is necessary that you approve of yourself; the approval of others is pleasant but beside the point. Once you no longer need approval, the guilt for behavior which does not bring approval will disappear.
• Keep a _Guilt Journal_ and write down any guilty moments, noting precisely when, why, and with whom it occurs, and what you are avoiding in the present with this agonizing over the past. The journal should provide some helpful insights into your particular guilt zone.
• Reconsider your value system. Which values do you believe in and which do you only pretend to accept? List all of these phony values and resolve to live up to a code of ethics that is self-determined, not one that has been imposed by others.
• Make a list of all the bad things you’ve ever done. Give yourself guilt points for each of them on a scale of one to ten. Add up your score and see if it makes any difference in the present whether it’s one hundred or one million. The present-moment is still the same and all of your guilt is merely wasteful activity.
• Assess the real consequences of your behavior... ...determine whether the results of your actions are pleasing and productive for you.
• Teach those in your life who attempt to manipulate you with guilt that you are perfectly capable of handling their disappointment in you... ...It will take some time, but their behavior will begin to change once they see they cannot force you to choose guilt. Once you de-fuse the guilt, the emotional control over you and the possibility of manipulation are eliminated forever.
• Do something which you know is bound to result in feelings of guilt... ...These kinds of behavior will help you to tackle that omnipresent guilt that so many sectors of the environment are adept at helping you to choose.

By saying “You feel,” rather than “I feel,” the potential for guilt is tactfully minimized.

Such is guilt in our culture—a convenient tool for manipulating others and a futile waste of time.

Worry... ...is diagnostically identical to guilt, but focuses exclusively on the future and all of the terrible things that _might_ happen.

### A Closer Look at Worry

There is nothing to worry about! Absolutely nothing. You can spend the rest of your life, beginning right now, worrying about the future, and no amount of your worry will change a thing.

Worry is... ...being immobilized in the present as a result of things that are going or not going to happen in the future.

You must be careful not to confuse worrying with planning for the future. If you are planning, and the present-moment activity will contribute to a more effective future, then this is not worry. It is worry only when you are in any way immobilized now about a future happening.

Society... ...encourages worry... ...it all begins with equating worrying with caring. If you care about someone... ...then you are bound to worry about the person.

“I can’t help worrying, it’s because I love you.” Thus, you prove your love by doing an appropriate amount of worrying at the correct time.

Worry is endemic to our culture. Almost everyone spends an inordinate amount of present moments worrying about the future. And all of it is for naught.

Not one moment of worry will make things any better. In fact, worry will very likely help you to be less effective in dealing with the present.

Love predicates a relationship in which each person has the right to be what he chooses without any necessary conditions imposed by the other.

Think of yourself as being alive in 1860, at the beginning of the Civil War... ...there are approximately thirty-two million people in the United States. Each of those thirty-two million folks has hundreds of things to worry about... ...some years later, all of those worriers are dead and all their combined worrying did not change a moment of what is now history.

When the earth is populated by an entirely new crew, will any of your worry moments have made a difference? No.

Do any of your worry times make a difference today, in terms of changing the things you worry about? No, again.

You are just wasting those precious present moments on behavior that has absolutely no positive payoff for you.

Much of your worry concerns things over which you have no control.

You can worry all you want about war... ...but worry won’t bring peace.

> What a list! Something old and something new, something cosmic yet something trivial too, for the creative worrier must forever blend the pedestrian with the immemorial. If the sun burns out, will the Mets be able to play their entire schedule at night? If cryogenically frozen human beings are ever revived, will they have to re-register to vote? And if the little toe disappears, will field goals play a smaller part in the National Football
League?
> -The New Yorker, “Look for the Rusty Lining,” Ralph Schoenstein

You may be in the professional worrier classification, creating unnecessary stress and anxiety in your life as a result of the choices you are making to worry about every conceivable kind of activity. Or you may be a minor league worrier concerned only about your own personal problems. The following list represents the most common responses to the question, “What do you worry about?”

### Typical Worry Behaviors in our Culture

I gathered the following data from some two hundred adults at a lecture one evening. I call this your worry sheet... ...They are not listed in any particular sequence of frequency or importance... ...YOUR WORRY SHEET
I worry about...
1. My children (“Everyone worries about their children, I wouldn’t be a very good parent if I didn’t, now would I?”)
2. My health (“If you don’t worry about your health, you could die at anytime!”)
3. Dying (“No one wants to die. Everyone worries about death.”)
4. My job (“If you don’t worry about it, you might lose it.”)
5. The economy (“Someone ought to worry about it, the President doesn’t seem to care.”)
6. Having a heart attack (“Everyone does, don’t they?” “Your heart could go at any minute.”)
7. Security (“If you don’t worry about security, you’ll find yourself in the poorhouse, or on welfare.”)
8. My wife’s/husband’s happiness (“God knows I spend a lot of time worrying about him/her being happy, and they still don’t appreciate it.”)
9. Am I doing the right thing? (“I always worry about doing things right, that way I know I’m okay.”)
10. Having a healthy child if you’re pregnant (“Every mother-to-be worries about that.”)
11. Prices (“Somebody ought to worry about them before they skyrocket out of sight.”)
12. Accidents (“I always worry that my spouse or the children will have an accident. It’s only natural, isn’t it?”)
13. What others will think (“I worry about my friends not liking me.”)
14. My weight (“No one wants to be fat, so naturally I worry about not gaining back any of the weight I lost.”)
15. Money (“We never seem to have enough, and I worry that someday we’ll be broke and have to go on welfare.”)
16. My car breaking down (“It’s an old clunker and I drive it on the expressway, so of course I worry about it and what might happen if it did.”) 
17. 17. My bills (“Everyone worries about paying their bills. You wouldn’t be human if you didn’t worry about bills.”)
18. My parents dying (“I don’t know what I’d do if they died, it worries me sick. I worry about being alone, I don’t think I could handle it.”)
19. Getting into heaven or what if there is no God (“I can’t stand the idea of there being nothing.”)
20. The weather (“I plan things like a picnic and maybe it’ll rain. I worry about having snow for skiing.”)
21. Getting old (“No one wants to get old, and you can’t kid me, everyone worries about that one.” “I don’t know what I’ll do when I retire and I really worry about that.”)
22. Flying (“You hear about all those plane crashes.”)
23. My daughter’s virginity (“Every father who loves his daughter worries that she’ll be hurt, or get into trouble.”)
24. Talking in front of groups (“I get petrified in front of a crowd and I worry like crazy before I do it.”)
25. When my spouse doesn’t call (“It seems normal to me to worry when you don’t know where some one you love is, or if they’re in trouble.”)
26. Going into the city (“Who knows what’ll happen in the jungle. I worry every time I go in.” “I always worry about whether I’ll get a parking space.”)

And perhaps the most neurotic of all...
27. Having nothing to worry about (“I can’t just sit still when everything
seems all right, I worry about not knowing what will happen next.”)

> West Islip—Two officials of the Nassau-Suffolk Hospital Council warned yesterday that those _worrying_ about the problems that the malpractice insurance crisis could create—if doctors cease treating patients entirely or treat only emergency cases—have not _worried_ quite enough.
> —Newsday (May 3, 1975) on hospital malpractice insurance.
 
The cultural pressure is to worry, rather than to do.

If worry is a large part of your life, you can bet that it has many historical antecedents.

Worry and guilt are self-nullifying behaviors, that vary only in a temporal sense. Guilt focuses on the past; worry on the future.

### The Psychological Payoffs for Choosing Worry

- Worry is a present-moment activity. Thus, by using your current life being immobilized over a future time in your life, you are able to escape the now and whatever it is in the now that threatens you... ...While I love writing, I also find it an intensely lonely, difficult chore which requires a great deal of self-discipline... ...As long as I could use up my present moments worrying I didn’t have to struggle with the difficulty of writing. A terrific payoff indeed.
- You can avoid having to take risks by using your worry as the reason for immobility... ...“I can’t do a thing, I’m just too worried about———” This is a common lament, and one with a payoff that keeps you standing still and avoiding the risk of action.
- You can label yourself as a _caring person_ by worrying... ...A handsome dividend, although lacking in logical healthy thinking.
- Worry is a handy justification for certain self-defeating behavior... ...If you’re overweight, you undoubtedly eat more when you worry, hence you have a sensational reason for hanging on to the worry behavior... ...The worry helps you to avoid changing. It is easier to worry... ...than to take the risk of finding out the truth.
- Your worry keeps you from living... ...A worrier sits around and thinks about things, while a doer must be up and about.
- Worry can bring ulcers, hypertension, cramps, tension headaches, backaches and the like. While these may not seem to be payoffs, they do result in considerable attention from others and justify much self-pity as well... ...some people would rather be pitied than fulfilled.

### Some Strategies for Eliminating worry

- View your present moments as times to live, rather than to obsess about the future... ...When you catch yourself worrying, ask yourself, “What am I avoiding now by using up this moment with worry?” Then begin to attack whatever it is you’re avoiding... ...The best antidote to worry is action.
- Recognize the preposterousness of worrry... ...Ask yourself over and over, “Is there anything that will ever change as a result of my worrying about it?”
- Give yourself shorter and shorter periods of “worry-time.”... ...Use these periods to fret about every potential disaster you can get into the time slot. Then, using your ability to control your own thoughts, postpone any further worry until your next designated “worry-time.” You’ll soon see the folly of using any time in this wasteful fashion, and will eventually eliminate your worry zone completely.
- Make a worry list of everything you worried about yesterday, last week and even last year. See if any of your worry did anything productive for you... ...Worry is really a doubly wasteful activity. It does nothing to alter the future. And the projected catastrophe often turns out to be minor, or even a blessing when it arrives.
- _Just Worry!_ See if it is something that you can demonstrate when you are tempted to worry. That is, stop and turn to someone and say, “Watch me—I’m about to worry.” They’ll be confounded since you probably won’t even know how to demonstrate the thing you do so well, so often.
- Ask yourself... ...“What’s the worst thing that could happen to me (or them) and what is the likelihood of it occurring?” You’ll discover the absurdity of worry in this way.
- Deliberately choose to act in some manner that is in direct conflict with your usual areas of worry... ...If you compulsively save for the future... ...begin to use your money today. Be like the rich uncle who put in his will, “Being of sound mind, I spent all my money while I was alive.”
- Begin to face the fears you possess with productive thought and behavior... ...an effective challenge to a fear or worry is the most productive way to eradicate it from your life.
- The most effective weapon you have for wiping out worry is your own determination to banish this neurotic behavior from your life.

### Final Thoughts on Worry and Guilt

The present moment is the key to understanding your guilt and worry activities. Learn to live now and not waste your current moments in immobilizing thoughts about the past or future.

There is no other moment to live but now, and all of your futile guilt and worry are done in the elusive now.

## 6 Exploring the Unknown

Only the insecure strive for security.

Early training in our society tends to encourage caution at the expense of curiosity, safety at the expense of adventure.

Avoid the questionable, stay in areas that you know, never wander into the unknown. These early messages can become a psychological barrier that prevents your own personal fulfillment and present-moment happiness in countless ways.

> The most beautiful thing we can experience is the mysterious. It is the true source of all art and science.
> -Albert Einstein, “What I Believe” in Forum (October 1930),

> The most beautiful thing we can experience is the mysterious. It is the true source of all art and science. it is the source of all growth and excitement as well.
> -Wayne W. Dyer

Too many people equate the unknown with danger.

As a young scout you were told to _Be Prepared._ But how can you prepare for the unknown? Obviously, you cannot! Therefore avoid it and you’ll never end up with egg on your face. Be safe, don’t take risks, follow the road maps—even if it is dull.

You can’t grow if you already know the answers before the questions have even been asked.

The times you most remember are those in which you were spontaneously alive, doing whatever you wanted, and delightfully anticipating the mysterious.

We hear the cultural messages of certainty throughout life... ...The child learns to avoid experimentation and is encouraged to avoid the unknown.

Get rid of the idea that you can’t try out new and doubtful behavior. You can if you choose to.

### Openness to New Experiences

If you believe in yourself fully, no activity is beyond your potential.

The entire gamut of human experience is yours to enjoy, once you decide to venture into territory where you don’t have guarantees.

People who are regarded as geniuses... ...They weren’t people who could do only one thing well. They weren’t individuals who avoided the unknown... ...were pioneers, adventurers into new, unreliable areas.

> “Nothing human is alien to me.”
> -Albert Schweitzer, another Renaissance Man

Look at yourself with new eyes, and open yourself up to experiences that you’ve never even considered as a part of your own human potential.

Opening yourself up to new experiences means surrendering the notion that it is better to tolerate something familiar than to work at changing it because change is fraught with uncertainty.

You stand a much better chance of avoiding psychological collapse if you eliminate some of the routine and sameness in your life.

Boredom is debilitating and psychologically unhealthy.

The “if it’s unusual I must stay away from it” mentality inhibits your openness to new experiences.

There are uncountable activities and people who are considered taboo merely because they are unknown.

You may also believe that you must have a reason for doing something; otherwise what’s the point of doing it? Balderdash! You can do anything you want just because you want to, and for no other reason.

You don’t need a reason for anything that you do.

Looking for a reason for everything is the kind of thinking that keeps you from new and exciting experiences.

As a child you could play... ...for an hour, for no reason but that you liked it... ...Why? Because you wanted to. But as an adult, you have to come up with a good reason for things.

Passion for reasons keeps you from opening up and growing.

You can do whatever you want because you want to and for no other reason.

### Rigidity vs. Spontaneity

Spontaneity means being able to try anything, at the spur of the second, just because it is something you’d enjoy.

You may even discover that it’s something you don’t enjoy doing but you did enjoy attempting it.

You will be condemned as irresponsible or incautious, but what does the judgment of others matter when you’re having such a marvelous time discovering the unknown.

Independent thinking is discouraged, and there are official guidelines for how one should think and speak.

The rigid never grow. They tend to do things the same way they’ve always done them.

Have you really lived 10,000 or more days or have you lived one day, 10,000 or more times?

### Prejudice and Rigidity

Rigidity is the basis of all prejudice, which means to _prejudge_... ...is based... ...on the fact that it’s easier and safer to stay with the known.

Being spontaneous means eliminating your prejudgments and allowing yourself to meet and deal with new people and ideas.

If you don’t trust anyone you can’t get a “handle on”; it really means you don’t trust yourself on unfamiliar grounds.

### The “Always Having a Plan” Trap

There is no such thing as planned spontaneity. It is a contradiction in terms.

A plan is not necessarily unhealthy, but falling in love with the plan is the real neurosis.

You may have a plan... ...and then you simply consult... ...to see where you ought to be, rather than making a new decision each day and having a strong enough belief in yourself to be able to alter the plan.

Don’t let the plan become bigger than you.

### Security: Internal and External Varieties

You learned how to write a high school theme or essay... ...you may have applied the same logic to your life... ...The introduction was your childhood... ...The body is your adult life... ...preparation for your conclusion, which is the retirement and happy ending. All of this organized thinking keeps you from living your present moments.

Living according to this plan implies a guarantee that everything will be okay forever. Security, the final plan, is for cadavers.

Security means knowing what is going to happen. Security means no excitement, no risks, no challenge.

Security means no growth and no growth means death.

Certainty eliminates excitement—and growth.

The word security as used here refers to external guarantees, possessions such as money, a house and a car, to bulwarks such as a job or a position in the community. But there is a different kind of security that is worth pursuing, and this is the internal security of trusting yourself to handle anything that may come down the pike. This is the only lasting security, the only real security.

Things can break down, a depression can wipe out your money, your house can be repossessed, but you, you can be a rock of self-esteem.

You can believe so much in you and your internal strength that things or others will be seen as mere pleasant but superfluous adjuncts to your life.

Security can be redefined as the knowledge that you can handle anything, including having no external security.

External security robs you of your ability to live and grow and fulfill yourself.

People without external security... ...are way ahead of the game... ...they can try new things and avoid the trap of always having to stay with the safe.

> Someday I’ll walk away And be free 
And leave the sterile ones Their secure sterility.
I’ll leave without a forwarding address And walk across some barren wilderness
To drop the world there. Then wander free of care
Like an unemployed Atlas
> -James Kavanaugh in Will You Be My Friend?. Little poem called Some Day.

### Achievement as Security

“Walking away” to “be free,” as Kavanaugh puts it, is difficult as long as you carry around the conviction that you must achieve.

Fear of failure is a powerful fear in our society, one inculcated in childhood and often carried throughout life.

Failure does not exist. Failure is simply someone else’s opinion of how a certain act should have been completed.

Once you believe that no act must be performed in any specific other-directed way, then failing becomes impossible.

There may, however, be occasions when you will fail in some given task according to your own standards. The important thing here is not to equate the act with your own self-worth. Not to succeed in a particular endeavor is not to fail as a person. It is simply not being successful with that particular trial at that particular present moment.

Try to imagine using failure as a description of an animal’s behavior. Consider a dog barking... ...and someone saying, “He really isn’t very good at barking... ...It is impossible for an animal to fail because there is no provision for evaluating natural behavior.

Spiders construct webs, not successful or unsuccessful webs. Cats hunt mice; if they aren’t successful in one attempt, they simply go after another. They don’t lie there and whine, complaining about the one that got away, or have a nervous breakdown because they failed.

Natural behavior simply is!... ...apply the same logic to your own behavior and rid yourself of the fear of failure.

The push to achieve comes from three of the most self-destructive words in our culture... ...Do your best! This is the cornerstone of the achievement neurosis... ...What’s wrong with taking a mediocre bicycle ride, or going for an average walk in the park? Why not have some activities in your life which you just do, rather than do to the best of your ability?

The do-your-best neurosis can keep you from trying new activities and enjoying old ones.

### Perfectionism

Why should you have to do everything well?

Winston Churchill’s famous lines about perfectionism... ...The maxim “nothing avails but perfection” may be spelled PARALYSIS.

Having to do your best, or even to do well, is an obstacle to doing.

Don’t let perfectionism keep you on the sidelines avoiding potentially pleasurable activities. Try changing “Do your best” to simply “Do.”

Perfection means immobility.

If you have perfect standards for yourself, then you’ll never try anything and you won’t do much because perfect is not a concept that applies to human beings.

If you have children, don’t... ...insisting they do their best. Instead, talk with them about the things they seem to enjoy the most, and give some encouragement to try hard in those areas.

No one should be taught to be competitive, to try, or even to do well. Instead, try to teach the lessons of self-esteem and pride and pleasure in the activities deemed important by the individual.

A child is easily taught the ugly message of equating his own self-worth with his failures. Consequently he will begin to shun activities in which he does not excel. Even more dangerous, he may develop habits of low self-esteem, approval-seeking, guilt and all of the erroneous zone behaviors that go with self- rejection.

If you equate your worth with your failures and successes, you’ll be doomed to feelings of worthlessness.

Failure can be instructive. It can be an incentive to work and exploration. It can even be thought as success if it points the way to new discoveries.

> I have revised some folk wisdom lately; one of my edited proverbs is _Nothing fails like success_ because you do not learn anything from it. The only thing we ever learn from is failure. Success only confirms our superstitions.
> -Kenneth Boulding
 
Without failure we can learn nothing, and yet we have learned to treasure success as the only acceptable standard.

We tend to shun all experiences which might bring about failure.

Fearing failure means fearing both the unknown and the disapproval that accompanies not doing your best.

### Some Typical “Fear of the Unknown” Behavior In Our Culture

Typical behavior engendered by fear of the unknown. Resisting new experiences, rigidity, prejudice, slavish adherence to plans, the need for external security, fear of failure and perfectionism are all subheadings in this large self-limiting zone. 

Listing of the most common specific examples:
- Eating the same kinds of foods for a lifetime. Avoiding exotic, new taste treats in favor of the more traditional.
- Wearing the same kinds of clothes forever. Never trying out a new style, or wearing something different.
- Reading the same newspapers and magazines which support the same editorial position day after day and never admitting a contrary viewpoint.
- Seeing the same movies (with different titles) for a lifetime. Refusing to view anything that might support a different philosophical or political belief, because the unknown is disconcerting and must be shut out.
- Living in the same neighborhood, city or state, simply because your parents and their parents happened to have chosen that location. Being afraid of a new place because the people, climate, politics, language, customs, or whatever, are different.
- Refusing to listen to ideas which you do not share. Instead of considering the other speaker’s viewpoint—“Hmm, I’ve never thought of that”—you immediately insist he’s crazy or uninformed
- Being afraid to try a new activity because you can’t do it well.
- Compulsive achievement in school or on the job. Grades are more important than anything else. The fitness report matters more than the pleasure of work well done.
- Avoiding anyone whom you label deviant... ...Rather than trying to learn about these people, you label them with a slanderous epithet and talk about them rather than to them.
- Staying with the same job even though you dislike it, not because you have to, but out of apprehension about entering that vast unknown of new work.
- Staying in a marriage that obviously is not working, out of a fear of the unknown, single life.
- Taking vacations in the same place, at the same hotel, during the same season each year.
- Using performance rather than enjoyment as a criteria for everything that you do. That is, doing only those things you do well and avoiding those where you might fail or perform poorly.
- Measuring things in monetary terms. If it costs more, it is worth more, and therefore an indication of your personal success.
- Striving for the important title, the fancy automobiles, the right labels on your clothes and other status symbols, even though you may not even like the possessions and the life-style that they represent.
- An inability to alter a plan when an interesting alternative arises.
- Being preoccupied with time, and allowing clocks to run your life. Living by a schedule which keeps you from trying new and unknown quantities of life.
- Dismissing certain kinds of activities which you’ve never tried... ...or anything that you don’t know about.
- Viewing sex without imagination. Always doing the same thing in the same position.
- Hiding behind the same clique of friends and never branching out with different people who represent new and unknown worlds.
- Hanging back because of a fear of what might happen if you ventured into a conversation with strange people on strange topics.
- Condemning yourself if you don’t succeed in all your endeavors.

### The Psychological Support System for Retaining These Behaviors

Payoffs that keep you from roaming around in that delicious unknown:
- By staying the same you never have to think on your feet. If you have a good plan, you simply consult your script, rather than your wits.
- Staving off the unknown has its own built-in reward system. The fear of the obscure is strong, and as long as you stay with the familiar, you are keeping that fear at bay, regardless of how costly it is to you in growth and fulfillment... ...The unknown is a challenge and challenges can be threats.
- You can say that you are postponing your gratification, which you’ve heard labeled “mature-behavior,” and thus stay with the familiar and justify it with such a stance.
- You can feel important by having done it right. You’ve been a good boy/girl. As long as you see it in failure/success terms, you can equate your self- worth with your good performance and feel good. But the right thing in this sense is only someone else’s editorial opinion.

### Some Strategies for Coming to Grips with the Mysterious and the Unknown
- Make selective efforts to try new things even if you are tempted to stay with the familiar.
- Invite a collection of people to your home who represent widely divergent points of view.
- Give up having to have a reason for everything you do. When someone asks you why, remember that you don’t have to come up with a reasonable answer that will satisfy them. You can do what you decide just because you want to.
- Begin to take some risks that will get you out of your routine.
- Interview for a new job, or talk with someone that you’ve been avoiding because you were afraid of not knowing what might happen. Take a new route to work, or have dinner at midnight. Why? Just because it’s different and you want to do it.
- Entertain yourself with a fantasy in which you allow yourself to have anything you want. No holds barred. You have all of the money to do anything you want for a two-week period. You’ll find that almost all of your mental meanderings are indeed attainable for you, that you don’t want the moon or the unreachable, but simply things that you can achieve if you eliminate the fear of the unknown and go after them.
- Take a risk that might involve some personal upheaval, but which would be intensely rewarding to you.
- Whenever you find yourself avoiding the unknown, ask yourself, “What’s the worst thing that could happen to me?” You’ll probably see that the fears of the unknown are out of proportion to the reality of the consequences.
- Try out some of the things that you’ve always avoided because you “Mustn’t ever do such things.” Open your own personal horizons to new experiences that you’ve previously avoided because they were silly or inane.
- Remind yourself that the fear of failure is very often the fear of someone else’s disapproval or ridicule. If you let them have their own opinions, which have nothing to do with you, you can begin to evaluate your behavior in your own, rather than their terms. You’ll come to see your abilities not as better or worse, but as simply different from others.
- Make an attempt to do some things that you’ve always avoided, with the sentence “I’m just not good at that.”
- Remember that the opposites of growth are sameness and death. Thus, you can resolve to live each day in a new way, being spontaneous and alive, or you can fear the unknown and remain the same—psychologically dead.
- Have a talk with those people in your life who you feel are most responsible for your fear of the unknown. State in no uncertain terms that you intend to do new things, and check out their reactions. You may find that their incredulity is one of the things that you’ve always worried about in the past, and as a result you chose immobilization over those disapproving looks. Now that you can handle the looks, state your Declaration of Independence from their control.
- Instead of “Do your best in everything” as a credo for you and your children, try “Select the things that are important to you, and work hard at them, and in the rest of your life, just do.” It’s O.K. not to do your best! In fact, the whole “Do your Best,” syndrome is a myth. You never do your absolute best, nor does anyone else. There is always room for improvement, since perfection is not a human attribute.
- Don’t let your convictions keep you stagnant. Believing something out of past experience and hanging onto that belief is an avoidance of reality. There is only what is now, and the truth of the present may not be the truth of the past. Assess your behavior not on what you believe, but in terms of what is and what you experience in the present. By allowing yourself to experience, rather than coloring your reality with beliefs, you’ll find the unknown a fantastic place to be.
- Remember, nothing human is alien to you. You can be anything you choose. Imprint this on your mind and remind yourself of it when you fall into your typically safe evasive behavior.
- Become aware of avoiding the unknown as you are doing it. At that moment begin a dialogue with yourself. Tell yourself it’s okay if you don’t know where you are going at every moment of your life. Awareness of routine is the first step in changing it.
- Deliberately fail at something.
- Have a conversation with a member of a group that you’ve avoided in the past... ...If you prejudge anyone, you prevent yourself from dealing with them honestly since your viewpoint has already been established... ...The more different kinds of people you encounter, the more likely you are to remark to yourself how much you’ve been missing, and how foolish your fears have been.

Awareness of routine is the first step in changing it.

### Some Final Thoughts on Fearing the Unknown

Fighting fear of the unknown... ...process begins with new insights into your avoidance behavior, followed by actively challenging the old behavior and moving in new directions.

> Two roads diverged in a wood, and I— I took the one less traveled by,
And that has made all the difference.
> -Robert Frost, The Road Not Taken.

You don’t have to know where you’re going—as long as you’re on your way.

## 7 Breaking the Barrier of Convention

There are no rules, laws or traditions that apply universally...including this one.

The world is full of “shoulds” that people apply to their behavior without evaluation.

You may be guided by a set of rules and principles to which you don’t even subscribe, and yet you are unable to break away and decide for yourself what works and doesn’t work for you.

Nothing is absolute.

There are no rules or laws which always make sense or provide the greatest amount of good for all occasions.

Flexibility is a far greater virtue, and yet you may find it difficult, indeed impossible, to break an unserviceable law or violate absurd tradition.

Laws are necessary, and order is an important part of civilized society.

Blind adherence to convention... ...may be far more destructive to the individual than violation of the rules.

Often rules are foolish, and traditions no longer make any sense... ...and you are unable to function effectively... ...that is the time to reconsider the rules and your behavior.

> I never had a policy that I could always apply. I’ve simply attempted to do what made the greatest amount of sense at the moment.
> -Abraham Lincoln

If you find yourself doing annoying or otherwise counterproductive things which are the result of a should, you have renounced your freedom of choice and are allowing yourself to be controlled by some external force.

### Internal vs. External Locus of Control

Seventy-five percent of the people in our culture are more external than internal in their personality orientation.

To be “external” in your locus of control?... ...you are external if you assign responsibility for your emotional state in your present moments to someone or something external to yourself.

The internal locus of control person puts the responsibility for how he feels squarely on his own shoulders, and this person is indeed rare in our culture.

“I’m in charge of me, and this is where I choose to be.”

Virtually all shoulds and traditions are imposed by external sources. That is, they come from someone or something outside of yourself.

If you are loaded with shoulds and unable to break conventions which are prescribed by others, then you are in the external bag.

Barbara... ...obesity problem... ...Instead of recognizing that she had chosen to overeat in the past and she would have to learn to make new choices if she wanted to lose weight, Barbara turned to other people and things—society’s accepted conventions for weight loss... ...Finally Barbara realized that therapy had nothing to do with anything outside herself.

Fatalists, determinists and people who believe in luck are in the external slot. If you believe that your life is mapped out for you in advance, and you need only follow the appropriate roads, then you are very likely loaded with all of the shoulds that will keep you on your road map.

Being effective does not mean eliminating all of the problems in your life. It does mean moving your locus of control from the external to the internal.

You make yourself responsible for everything that you experience emotionally.

You can take a sterner look at the “rules” and begin to exercise some internal control over your own thinking, feeling and behavior.

#### Blaming and Hero Worship: Opposite Ends of the same Externally Directed Behavior

Blame is a neat little device that you can use whenever you don’t want to take responsibility for something in your life.

All blame is a waste of time.

No matter how much fault you find with another, and regardless of how much you blame him, it will not change you.

The only thing blame does is keep the focus off you when you are looking for external reasons to explain your unhappiness or frustration.

If blame has some effect, it will not be on you. You may succeed in making another feel guilty for something by blaming him, but you won’t succeed in changing whatever it is about you that is making you unhappy.

You may succeed in not thinking about it; but you won’t succeed in changing it.

The tendency to focus on others can go to the opposite extreme where it surfaces as hero worship... ...you may find yourself looking to others to determine your values. If so-and-so does it, then I should do it too.

Hero worship is a form of self-repudiation. It makes others more important than you, and relates your own fulfillment to something outside of yourself.

While there is nothing self-defeating about appreciating others and their accomplishments, it becomes an erroneous zone when you model your own behavior on their standards.

All of your heroes are people. They are all human. They do the same things that you do every day.

The only good hero is a ham and cheese or possibly an eggplant par-migiana.

All the great heroes of your life have taught you nothing. And they are no better than you, in any way... ...just skillful at what they do—nothing more.

If you make them your heroes and elevate them to positions above yourself, then you are into that external bag of giving others the responsibility for your good feelings.

If you blame at one end or hero worship at the other, you are someplace on this Focusing On Others Line.

![The Focusing On Others Line](the-focusing-on-others-line.jpg)

You are behaving as a fool if you look outside of you for an explanation of how you should feel or what you should do.

Taking credit as well as responsibility for yourself is the first step to eliminating this erroneous zone.

Be your own hero.

### The Right vs. Wrong Trap

The question of right vs. wrong as it applies here has nothing to do with religious, philosophical or moral issues of _a priori_ rightness or wrongness. That is a discussion for another place. Here the subject is you, and how your notions of right and wrong get in the way of your own happiness.

Your rights and wrongs are your universal shoulds.

You may have adopted some unhealthy stances which include right means good or just, while wrong is equated with bad or unjust. This is nonsense. Rights and wrongs in this sense do not exist.

The word right implies a guarantee that if you do something a certain way, you’ll have sure-fire results. But there are no guarantees.

Think... ...of any decision... ...the moment it becomes a question of right vs. wrong, you are trapped into the “I’ve always got to be right and when things or people are not right, then I’m going to be unhappy” trap.

Perhaps some of your need to find the right answer has to do with the search for certainty.

Tendency to dichotomize... ...to divide the world neatly into extremes such as black/white, yes/no, good/bad and right/wrong.

Most intelligent folks roam around in those gray areas, rarely coming to rest on either black or white.

In... ...adult relationships. Discussions inevitably become a contest which results in one partner being right, and the other wrong.

There is no right and wrong here. People are different and they see things from different perspectives. If one must be right, then a breakdown in communication is the only predictable outcome.

All rights and wrongs of every description represent shoulds of one kind or another.

### Indecisiveness As a Spin-Off of Right vs. Wrong Thinking

Have difficulty with decision-making, even with small things is a direct outgrowth of the inclination to divide things into right and wrong categories.

The indecision comes from wanting to be right, and the postponement of a choice keeps you from dealing with the anxiety that you choose for yourself whenever you feel you’ve been wrong.

Once you take away the rightness and wrongness of every decision (because right implies a guarantee), then decision-making will become a snap.

Neither is right, one is simply different than the other, and you’ll have no guarantees regardless of the choice.

You can ease your indecision-neurosis by viewing all potential outcomes as being neither right nor wrong... ...Simply different.

Once you give up... ...rights and wrongs, you’ll find decision-making a simple matter of weighing which consequences you’d prefer at a given present- moment.

If you begin to choose regret over the decision, rather than deciding that regret is a waste of your time (because it keeps you living in the past) you’ll simply resolve to make a different decision in your next present moment, one that will bring consequences that the earlier decision failed to bring.

Nothing is more important than anything else. The child collecting seashells is not doing something more right or wrong than the President of General Motors making a major corporate decision. They are different. Nothing more!

Who decides the rightness? That is the question that can never be answered satisfactorily. The law doesn’t decide if it’s wrong, only if it’s legal.

> We can never be sure that the opinion we are endeavoring to stifle is false opinion, and if we were sure, stifling it would be an evil still.
> -John Stuart Mill, On Liberty

Your effectiveness is not measured by your ability to make a right choice.

How you handle yourself emotionally after any choice is a far greater barometer of your personal present-moment togetherness, since a right choice represents those shoulds that you are working at eliminating.

New thinking will be helpful on two counts—one, you’ll banish those senseless shoulds and become more internal, and two, you’ll find decision-making less troublesome without those erroneous right and wrong categories.

### The Folly of Shoulds, Musts and Oughts

> “Musterbation” Tendency to incorporate shoulds into your life.
> -Albert Ellis

You are “musterbating” whenever you find yourself behaving in ways that you feel you must, even though you might prefer some other form of behavior.

> The shoulds always produce a feeling of strain, which is all the greater the more a person tries to actualize his shoulds in his behavior.... Furthermore, because of externalizations, the shoulds always contribute to disturbance in human relations in one way or another
> -Karen Horney, Neurosis and Human Growth, “The Tyranny of the Should.”
 
Do shoulds determine much of your life?... ...if... ...you fail in one of these shoulds do you berate yourself.. ..perhaps these are not your shoulds. If, in fact, they belong to others and you have merely borrowed them, then you are musterbating.

There are just as many should-nots as there are shoulds.

You don’t have to musterbate. Ever. It’s all right to be lacking in composure, or to not understand.

No one is keeping score on you, or going to punish you for not being something that someone else said you must be.

You can never be anything that you don’t want to be all of the time. It’s just not possible.

The strain does not result from your undignified, nonsupportive, indiscreet or whatever behavior, but from the imposition of the should.

### Etiquette as a Should

Etiquette is a beautiful example of useless and unhealthy enculturation.

While good manners are certainly appropriate—they simply entail consideration for other people—about ninety percent of all the etiquette guidelines are meaningless rules that were composed arbitrarily at one time.

There is no proper way for you; there is only what you decide is right for you— as long as you don’t make it hard for others to get along.

You can choose... ...what you’ll wear, how you’ll speak, where you’ll sit, how you’ll eat, and so on, strictly on the basis of what you want.

Anytime you fall into the trap of “What _should_ I wear,” or “How _should_ I do it,” you’re giving up a chunk of yourself.

Being a social rebel... ...would be a form of approval-seeking through nonconformity, but rather this is a plea for being self-rather than other-directed in the everyday running of your life.

Being true to yourself means being devoid of the need for an external support system.

### Blind Obedience to Rules and Laws

Some of the most despicable human behavior ever recorded was done under the guise of following orders.

> Those who are too lazy and comfortable to think for themselves and be their own judges obey the laws. Others sense their own laws within them; things are forbidden to them that every honorable man will do any day in the year and other things are allowed to them that are generally despised.
Each person must stand on his own feet.
> -Hermann Hesse, Demian
 
If you must comply with all the rules all the time, you are destined to a life of emotional servitude. But our culture teaches that it is naughty to disobey, that you shouldn’t do anything that is against the rules.

The important thing is to determine for yourself which rules work, and are necessary to preserve order in our culture and which can be broken without harm to yourself or others.

There is no percentage in rebelling just for the sake of rebelling, but there are great rewards in being your own person and living your life according to your own standards.

### Resisting Enculturation and Traditions When They Affect You Negatively

Progress depends on individuals who are innovators, who reject convention and fashion their own worlds.

You may be viewed by some as insubordinate, which is the price you’ll pay for thinking for yourself.

No one wants to destroy society, but many of us would like to give the individual more freedom within it.

What we are striving for is choice, that is, the ability to be free from the servant mentality of constant adherence to the shoulds. You do not have to be always as your culture expects you to be.

Leading your own life involves flexibility and repeated personal assessments of how well the rule works at a particular present moment.

If you’re going to learn to resist enculturation, you’ll have to become a shrugger. Others will still choose to obey even if it hurts them, and you will have to learn to allow them their choice. No anger, only your own convictions.

Resisting enculturation means making decisions for yourself and carrying them out as efficiently and quietly as possible.
 
The foolish rules, traditions and policies will never go away, but you don’t have to be a part of them. Just shrug as others go through their sheep motions. If they want to behave that way, fine for them but that’s not for you.

You’ll find scores of everyday occurrences where it is easier to circumvent the rules quietly than to start a protest movement. 

You can decide to be the person you want to be, or the one others want you to be. It’s up to you.

Virtually all new ideas which have resulted in change in our society were at one time scorned, and many of them were illegal as well.

All progress involves flying in the face of old rules that no longer apply.

### Some Typical should Behaviors

- Believing that there is a place for everything and everything must be in its place.
- Asking “What should I wear” on a regular basis, as if there were only one acceptable mode of dressing and it is determined by other people.
- Assuming that certain drinks must go with certain food. White wine must accompany fish and fowl. Red wine goes only with beef.
- Shifting blame for your actions to others.
- You must go to a wedding or send a gift, even if you don’t like them... ...because that’s the way things are supposed to be done.
- Giving titles to those who serve you, which elevates them by implication to a position higher than you... ...If he is paid to serve you, why is it that he gets a title and you get called by your name?
- Going to bed when it gets to be bedtime, rather than when you’re tired.
- Having sex only one or two ways because those are the only acceptable ways, or only participating in sexual activities when all conditions are met, such as, the kids are asleep, you are not tired, it’s dark in the room, you’re in your own bed, and on and on.
- Selecting roles in daily living because the culture demands it. Women do the dishes, men take out the garbage.
- Obedience to silly household rules and traditions that don’t work for your family.
- Following the dictates of all signs whether they make sense or not... ...Never challenging a sign, or even assuming that it doesn’t belong there in the first place. People make signs and people also make mistakes.
- When reading a book, always starting at page one and reading every word to the end, even if half of it doesn’t apply. Finishing a book you don’t like because you’re halfway through it, and, if you’ve read half, you must read it all.
- Women never asking men for dates. After all, that’s the male’s role.
- Striving for grades in school or forcing your children to do so.
- Going everywhere with your partner because it is expected, even though you both would prefer to be in different places at that particular time.
- Consulting a “how-to” book for everything, because every job must be done a certain way. Not being able to differentiate between manuals that impart useful information and those that merely tell you how things ought to be.
- Being anxious over the search for the right item and as a result being in that indecision and doubt bag.
- Making rewards, plaques, titles, honors and all merit badges more important than your own evaluation of your achievements.
- Applauding in an audience when you didn’t like the performance.
- Tipping for poor service.

### A Look at the Common Payoffs of Musterbation

Some of the reasons you have for hanging onto your shoulds are... ...Some of the reasons you have for hanging onto your shoulds are.

- You can take solace in being a “good boy” or a “good girl” by following all of your shoulds.
- Your obedience to the external should allows you to assign the responsibility for your standing still to the should rather than to yourself. As long as the should is the rationale for what you are (or aren’t), you can avoid the risks involved in trusting yourself to change. Thus your shoulds keep you from growing.
- Your musts make it possible for you to maneuver others. By telling someone this is the way it should be done, you can make him do it the way you want it to be done.
- It is easier to haul out a should when you lack confidence in yourself. As your self-image wanes, the should becomes your bulwark.
- You can remain self-righteous about your behavior and retain your hostility when others don’t fit into the shoulds that you have for yourself and the rest of the world.
- You can win approval by conforming.
- As long as you focus on others, and live through their successes and failures, you don’t have to work on yourself. Having heroes can reinforce your own low opinion of yourself and allow you to escape from having to work on yourself. As long as the heroes can be the cause of your good feelings, or responsible for your bad feelings, there is no reason for you to take on that responsibility.

### Some Strategies for Removing Some of Your Shoulds

Doing! Resolving to be different than the way you’ve been taught is proper when that way doesn’t work for you.

- Begin with insight into your own behavior. Study the neurotic dividends spelled out above. Then ask yourself why are you burdening yourself with so many shoulds. Ask yourself if you really believe in them, or if you’ve just become accustomed to behaving that way.
- List all of the rules you abide by, which just don’t seem to apply.
- Start your own traditions.
- Have a consultation with your relatives and friends about the many rules of conduct you all follow which you find distasteful. Perhaps you’ll be able to bring about some new rules which appear to be more reasonable to everyone. You’ll discover that the old rules are still in effect only because no one ever seriously thought to challenge them in the past.
- See how many rules you impose on others. Ask them if they really need those directives, or if they would behave in the identical fashion without them.
- Take a risk on challenging a rule or policy that you’d like to eliminate. But be prepared to deal without hostility with the consequences of your behavior.
- Think of decisions as having different consequences, rather than as being right or wrong... ...Trust yourself to make the decision rather than relying on some external kind of guarantee.
- Try to live in your present moments and make your rules and shoulds apply only for that time.
- Refuse to share your rule-breaking behavior with anyone. It is only for you, and you don’t want to get into an approval-seeking posture, in which the reason for resisting enculturation is to win attention and therefore adulation.
- Get rid of the roles that you (and others) are assuming in your life. Be whatever you want to be, rather than what you think you are supposed to be because you are a man, woman, middle-aged, or whatever.
- Refuse for a given segment of a conversation to focus on others. Practice in ever-increasing time periods not projecting blame, or talking about another person, event, or idea in a complaining or fault-finding manner.
- Stop waiting for others to change. Ask yourself why others should be different simply because you would like it better if they were. Recognize that every person has a right to be whatever they choose, even if you irritate yourself about it.
- Announce out loud that you just blamed and that you are working on eliminating this behavior. By stating it as a goal, you’ll be mindful of your proclivities in this direction.
- Decide that any and all unhappiness that you choose will never be the result of someone else, but rather that it will be the result of you and your own behavior... ...any externally caused unhappiness reinforces your own slavery, since it assumes that you have no control over yourself or them, but they have control over you.
- When someone is blaming, politely ask them, “Would you like to know if I want to hear what you are telling me right now?”... ...teach others not to use you as a blame receptacle and begin to label other people’s blaming and fault-finding so that you get in touch with recognizing it in yourself.
- Begin to trust yourself and give less credence to those external musts. - Remind yourself that what other people do is not what bothers you, it’s your reaction to it. Instead of saying “They shouldn’t do that,” say, “I wonder why I bother myself with what they are doing.”

Whether you blame or don’t, you stay as you are unless you _do_ something constructive to correct your dislikes.

### Some Final Thoughts on Should Behavior

> Men grind and grind in the mill of a truism, and nothing comes out but what was put in. But the moment they desert the tradition for a spontaneous thought, then poetry, wit, hope, virtue, learning anecdote, all flock to their aid.
> -Ralph Waldo Emerson, Literary Ethics in 1838.

Stay with tradition and you ensure that you’ll always be the same, but toss it aside, and the world is yours to use as creatively as you choose.

Become your own judge of your conduct and learn to rely on yourself to make present-moment decisions.

Sing your own song of happiness in any way that you choose, oblivious to how it is supposed to be.

## 8 The Justice Trap

If the world were so organized that everything had to be fair, no living creature could survive for a day. The birds would be forbidden to eat worms, and everyone’s self-interest would have to be served.

We are conditioned to look for justice in life and when it doesn’t appear, we tend to feel anger, anxiety or frustration.

Justice does not exist. It never has, and it never will.

Look at nature to realize there is no justice in the world. Tornadoes, floods, tidal waves, draughts are all unfair... ...The world and the people in it go on being unfair every day. You can choose to be happy or unhappy, but it has nothing to do with the lack of justice you see around you.

Justice is simply a concept that has almost no applicability, particularly as it pertains to your own choices about fulfillment and happiness. But too many of us tend to demand that fairness be an inherent part of our relations with others.

“It isn’t fair.” “You have no right to do that if I can’t” and “Would _I_ do that to you?”... ...We seek justice and use the lack of it as a justification for unhappiness.

The self-defeating behavior is not the demand for justice, but the immobilization that may result from no-justice-reality.

Our culture promises justice... ...Yet day after day, nay, century after century, the lack of justice continues... ...And if the history of humanity can be used as a guide they will continue.

Injustice is a constant, but you... ...can decide to fight that injustice and refuse to be seduced into being emotionally immobilized over it.

The legal system promises justice... ...But it generally doesn’t. Those with money are not convicted. Judges and policemen are often bought by the powerful. A President and Vice-President of the United States are pardoned or wrist-slapped for obvious felonies. The poor fill the jails, and have next to no chance of beating the system. It’s not fair. But it’s true.

Where is the justice? Nowhere! Your deciding to fight it may be admirable indeed, but your choosing to be upset by it is as neurotic as guilt, approval-seeking or any other of the self-flagellating behavior that constitutes your erroneous zones.

### “It’s Not Fair!” The Slogan of Ineffective Relationships

The demand for justice may infiltrate your personal relationships and prevent you from communicating effectively with others.

The “It’s not fair” slogan is one of the more common—and destructive—laments made by one person against another. In order for you to consider something unfair you must compare yourself to another individual or group of individuals... ...you’re determining what is good for you on the basis of someone else’s conduct. They, not you, are in charge of your emotions. If you are upset because of not being able to do something that someone else has done, then you’ve given them control over you. Whenever you compare yourself to anyone else, you are playing the “It’s not fair” game, and shifting from self-reliance to other-directed external thinking.

Fairness is an external concept—a way of avoiding the taking charge of your own life.’ Instead of thinking of anything as being unfair, you can decide what you really want, and then set about devising strategies for attaining it, independent of what anyone else in the world wants or does.

Everyone is different, and no amount of your bitching about others having it better than you will bring about any positive self-changes.

If you focus on yourself rather than compare yourself to others, then you will have no opportunity to upset yourself with the lack of equality you observe.

The backdrop for virtually all neurosis is making others’ behavior more significant than your own. If you carry around the “If he can do it, so should I” sentences, you’ll be running your life on the basis of someone else and never create your own life.

### Jealousy: A “Demand for Justice” Sideshow

John Dryden called jealousy “the jaundice of the soul.”

Jealousy is really a demand that someone love you in a certain way, and you saying “It isn’t fair” when they don’t. It comes from a lack of self-confidence.

People who really like themselves don’t choose jealousy or allow themselves to be distraught when someone else doesn’t play fair.

You can never predict how someone you love will react to another human being, but if they choose to be affectionate or loving you can only experience the immobility of jealousy if you see their decisions as having anything to do with you. That is your choice.

### Some Typical “Demand for Justice” Behaviors

“Searching-for-equity” behavior is obvious in virtually all areas of life. If you are the least bit perceptive you’ll see them cropping up over and over in yourself and others.

- Complaining that others make more money for doing the same work.
- Being upset that others get away with infractions, while you always get caught.
- All of the “Would I treat you that way?” sentences in which the assumption is that everyone should be exactly like you.
- Always reciprocating when someone does a favor for you. If you invite me for dinner, then I owe you one or at least a bottle of wine. This sort of behavior is often justified as good manners or politeness, but in reality it is simply a means of keeping the scales of justice in balance.
- Kissing someone back or saying “I love you, too” instead of accepting it and expressing your own feelings whenever you choose.
- Having sex with someone out of obligation, even though you don’t want to, because it really isn’t fair not to be cooperative.
- Always insisting on things being consistent.

> A foolish consistency is the hobgoblin of little minds.
> -Emerson’s often misquoted line

If you always want things to be the “right” way, you are in this “little-minds” category.

- In arguments, insisting on a clear-cut decision which calls for the winners to be right and the losers to admit that they were wrong.
- Using the fair argument in order to get your own way... ...” And then being upset because of the lack of fairness.
- Instead of blaming the entire mess on the lack of fairness, try looking hard at your own inability to decide for yourself what is most appropriate for you.
- The “If he can do it, so can I” game in which you justify something by someone else’s behavior. This can be the neurotic rationale for cheating, stealing, flirting, lying, being late, or anything that you’d rather not admit into your own value system.... ...This is the “He hit me, so I hit him” routine that is largely employed by children who have seen this behavior thousands of times in their own parents. It is the cause of war when extended to its ridiculous extreme.
- Spending the same amount of money on a gift that someone else spent on one for you. Paying back every favor with a favor of equal value. Keeping the tally sheet equal, rather than doing what you would like in such matters. After all, “It has to be fair.”

### Some of the Psychological Payoffs for Hanging Onto Your “Demands for Justice”

The rewards for this kind of behavior are generally self-defeating in that they keep the focus off reality and on some kind of a dream world that will never exist.

- You can feel smug with yourself for being honorable. It’s one way to make yourself feel superior and better.
- You can give up responsibility for yourself and justify being immobilized by shifting the responsibility to those people and events that are not fair... ...In this way, you can avoid risks, and the hard work of change. As long as injustice is the cause of your problems you can never change until the injustice goes away, which, of course, it never will.
- Injustice can win you attention, pity and self-pity. The world has been unjust to you and now you and everyone around you must feel sorry for you. This is another great technique for avoiding change.
- You can justify all kinds of immoral, illegal and inappropriate behavior by making your action someone else’s responsibility. If he can do it, so can I.
- It gives you a sensational self-excuse for being ineffective. “If they aren’t going to do anything, then neither am I.”
- It gives you a conversation topic and helps you to avoid talking about yourself to the people around you. Complain about all the injustices in the world and nothing gets done, but at least you killed those moments and maybe escaped dealing more honestly and personally with each other.
- As long as you have a concept of justice, you can always make the just decision.
- You can manipulate others, particularly your children, by reminding them that they are being unfair to you if they aren’t exactly the same as you, and don’t keep a precise tally of all give-and-take in the relationship.
- You can justify vindictive behavior because everything must be fair. This is a ploy for getting away with all kinds of manipulative and unsavory activities. Vengeance is justifiable because everything must be fair and even. Just as you must repay a favor, so you must repay a meanness.

### Some Strategies for Giving Up the Futile Insistence on Justice

- Make a list of everything in your world that you think is unfair... ...Ask yourself this important question. “Will the inequities go away if I am upset?” Obviously not.
- When you find yourself saying, “Would I do that to you?” or any similar sentence, change it to, “You are different from me, although I find that hard to accept right now.” This will open, rather than close communication between you and the other person.
- Begin to view your emotional life as independent of whatever anyone else does. This will free you from the chains of being hurt when others behave differently from the way you want them to.
- Try to view each decision not as a monumental life-changing event, but in perspective.

> A man of knowledge is one who lives by acting, not by thinking about acting, nor by thinking about what he will think when he has finished acting…He knows that his life will be over altogether too soon; he knows, because he sees, that nothing is more important than anything else…. Thus a man of knowledge sweats and puffs and if one looks at him he is just like any ordinary man, except that the folly of his life is under control. Nothing being more important than anything else, a man of knowledge chooses any act, and acts it out as if it mattered to him. His controlled folly makes him say that what he does matters and makes him act as if it did, and yet he knows that it doesn’t; so when he fulfills his acts he retreats in peace, and whether his acts were good or bad, or worked or didn’t, is in no way any part of his concern.
> -Carlos Castaneda

- Replace the sentence “It isn’t fair” with “It’s unfortunate,” or “I’d prefer…” Thus, instead of insisting that the world be other than it is, you begin to accept reality—but not necessarily to approve of it.
- Eliminate external references of comparison. Have your own goals... ...Set out to be what you want, without references to what others have or don’t have.
- Rather than paying someone off, by bringing wine or a gift in exchange for dinner or a party, wait until you feel like it and then send a bottle of wine with a note saying, “Just because I think you’re a great person.” There’s no need to balance the books with reciprocal trades; just do something nice because you, rather than a special occasion, call for it.
- Spend the amount of money you want to on any gift, and don’t be swayed by what was spent for you. Eliminate invitations based on obligation and fairness. Decide whom you’ll see on an internal rather than external standard.
- Be a doer, not a complainer about injustice. For every injustice you suffer, there is a resolution that does not require you to be immobilized in any way.
- Remember that revenge is just another way of being controlled by others. Do what you, not they, decide is for you.

It’s not the injustice that counts, it’s what you do about it.

## 9 Putting An End to Procrastination — Now

It takes not one drop of sweat to put off doing anything.

You may find yourself postponing many tasks that you want to accomplish, and yet for some reason you just keep suspending action.

Procrastination... ...is a mighty tiresome facet of life.

“I know I should be doing it, but I’ll get around to it later.” Your “putting it off” erroneous zone is difficult to blame on outside forces. It’s all yours—both the putting off and the discomfort you endure as a result of it.

Putting it off, in fact, doesn’t even exist. You simply do, and those things you don’t do, in reality, are just undone, rather than postponed.

It is only the accompanying emotional reaction and immobilization that represent neurotic behavior. If you feel that you put things off, and like it, with no attending guilt, anxiety or upset, then by all means hang onto it,

For most people procrastination is really an escape from living present moments as fully as possible.

### Hoping, Wishing and Maybe

Three neurotic phrases of the procrastinator: “I hope things will work out.” “I wish things were better.” “Maybe it’ll be okay.”

There you have the deferrer’s delight. As long as you say maybe, or hope, or wish, you can use these as a rationale for not doing anything now.

All wishing and hoping are a waste of time—the folly of fairyland residents.

You can do anything that you set your mind to accomplish. You are strong, capable and not the least bit brittle. But by putting things off for a future moment, you are giving into escapism, self-doubt, and most significantly, self-delusion.

Your putting it off zone is a movement away from being strong in your now, and toward the direction of hoping that things will improve in the future.

### Inertia as a Strategy for Living

Here is a sentence that can keep you inert, in your present moments: “I’ll wait, and it’ll get better.” For some this becomes a way of life—they are always putting it off for a day that can never arrive.

Things never work themselves out. They remain precisely as they are. At best, things change, but they don’t get better. Things themselves (circumstances, situations, events, people) will not improve alone. If your life is better, it is because you have done something constructive to make it better.

### How Procrastination Works

Donald Marquis called procrastination “the art of keeping up with yesterday.” To this I would add, “and avoiding today.”

Resolving to do something in the future which you could do now is an acceptable substitute for doing it, and permits you to delude yourself that you are really not compromising yourself by not doing what you have set out to do.

“I know I must do that, but I’m really afraid that I might not do it well, or I won’t like doing it. So, I’ll tell myself that I’ll do it in the future, then I don’t have to admit to myself that I’m not going to do it. And it is easier to accept myself this way.” This is the sort of convenient if fallacious reasoning that can be brought into play when you are faced with having to do something which is unpleasant or difficult.

If you are a person who lives one way and says you are going to live another way in the future, those proclamations are empty. You are simply a person who is always adjourning and never getting things done.

If you allow yourself an absolute minimum amount of time to get your work done, then you can justify sloppy results or less than top-notch performance by saying to yourself, “I just didn’t have enough time.” But you have plenty of time.

If you spend your time complaining about how much you have to do (procrastination), then you’ll have no present-moment time for doing it.

You are not necessarily what you say. Behavior is a much better barometer of what you are than words. What you do in your present moments is the only indicator of what you are as a person.

> Do not say things. What you are stands over you the while, and thunders so that I cannot hear what you say to the contrary.
> -Emerson

### Critics and Doers

A non-doer is very often a critic, that is, someone who sits back and watches doers, and then waxes philosophically about how the doers are doing.

It is easy to be a critic, but being a doer requires effort, risk and change.

#### THE CRITIC

Our culture is full of critics. We even pay to hear them.... ...Why? Because it is just plain easier to talk about how someone else has performed than to be the performer.

The real doers of the world have no time for criticizing others. They’re too busy doing. They work. They help others who are not as talented, rather than serve as their critics.

Constructive criticism can be useful. But if you’ve chosen the role of an observer rather than a doer, you are not growing.

You may be using your criticism to absolve yourself of the responsibility for your own ineffectiveness by projecting it onto those who are really making an effort.

Your first strategy will be to recognize these same behaviors in yourself, and resolve to eliminate them entirely, so that you can be a doer rather than a procrastinating critic.

### Boredom: A Spin-Off of Procrastination

Life is never boring but some people choose to be bored.

The concept of boredom entails an inability to use up present moments in a personally fulfilling way.

When you procrastinate, you use your present moments doing nothing, as an alternative to doing anything.

Doing nothing leads to boredom. The tendency is to blame boredom on the environment... ...and you can eliminate it by doing something else with your mind or energy at that moment.

> “The man who lets himself be bored is even more contemptible than the bore.”
> -Samuel Butler

By doing what you choose, now, or using your mind in creative new ways now, you can insure that you’ll never again choose boredom for yourself.

The choice, as always, is yours.

### Some Typical Procrastinating Behavior

- Staying in a job in which you find yourself stuck and unable to grow.
- Hanging onto a relationship that has gone sour.
- Refusing to work on relationship difficulties... ...Simply waiting for them to improve, instead of trying to do something constructive about them... ...- Not tackling addictions... ...Saying, “I’ll quit when I’m ready,” but knowing that you are putting it off because you doubt that you can.
- Putting off... ...menial tasks such as cleaning, repairing... ...and the like—providing you really care about whether or not they get done. If you wait long enough, maybe it will get done by itself.
- Avoiding a confrontation with others... ...By waiting, you end up not having to do it, although the confrontation might have improved the relationship or the service.
- Being afraid to change locations geographically. You stay in the same place for a lifetime... ...not going out for an evening to dinner, or to the theater or a sports event with your loved ones and using your “I’m busy” line to postpone it forever.
- Deciding to start your diet tomorrow or next week.
- Using sleep or tiredness as a reason for putting it off. Did you ever notice how tired you get when you are close to actually doing something uncomfortable or difficult? A little fatigue is a terrific deferring device.
- Getting sick when you are faced with a disquieting or troublesome task.
- The “I don’t have time to do it” ruse, in which you justify not doing something because of your busy schedule, which always has room for those things that you really want to do.
- Constantly looking forward to a vacation or that dream-trip.
- Being a critic and using your criticism of others to camouflage your own refusal to do.
- Refusing to get a physical checkup when you suspect some dysfunction. By putting it off you don’t have to deal with the reality of possible illness.
- Being afraid to make a move toward someone you’re fond of.
- Being bored at any time in your life. This is merely a way of putting off something and using the boring event as a reason for not doing something more exciting.
- Planning but never putting in action a regular exercise program.
- Living your entire life for your children and always putting off your own happiness.

### Reasons for Continuing to Put It Off

The rationale for putting it off is composed of one part self-delusion and two parts escape.

- Most obviously, putting it off allows you to escape from unpleasant activities. There may be things you’re afraid to do or things part of you wants to do and part of you doesn’t. Remember, nothing is black or white.
- You can feel comfortable with your self-delusional system.
- You can stay exactly as you are forever, as long as you keep putting it off. Thus you eliminate change and all the risks that go with it.
- By being bored you have someone or something else to blame for your unhappy state, thus you shift responsibility away from yourself and onto the boring activity.
- By being a critic you can feel important at the expense of others. It is a way of using others’ performance as stepping-stones for elevating yourself in your own mind. More self-delusion.
- By waiting for things to get better you can blame the world for your unhappiness—things just never seem to break for you.
- You can avoid ever having to fail by avoiding all activities which involve some risk.
- You can win sympathy from others and feel sorry for yourself for the anxiety that you live with as a result of not doing what you’d like to have done.
- You are able to justify a sloppy or less than acceptable performance on anything if you put it off long enough, and then just allow a minimal time segment for getting it done. “But I just didn’t have time.”
- By putting it off, you might be able to get someone else to do it for you. Thus, procrastination becomes a means of manipulating others.
- Putting it off enables you to delude yourself into believing that you are something other than what you really are.
- By avoiding a task you can escape success. If you don’t succeed you avoid having to feel good about yourself and accepting all of the continuing responsibility that goes with success.

### Some Techniques for Ousting This Postponing Behavior

- Make a decision to live five minutes at a time. Instead of thinking of tasks in long-range terms, think about now and try to use up a five-minute period doing what you want, refusing to put off anything that would bring about satisfaction.
- Sit down and get started on something you’ve been postponing... ...you’ll very likely find the job enjoyable, once you give up the procrastination.
- Ask yourself, “What is the worst thing that could happen to me if I did what I’m putting off right now?”... ...Assess your fear and you’ll have no reason to hang onto it.
- Give yourself a designated time slot... ...which you will devote exclusively to the task you’ve been putting off.
- Think of yourself as too significant to live with anxiety about the things you have to do.
- Look carefully at your now. Decide what you are avoiding in your current moments and begin to tackle the fear of living effectively. Procrastination is substituting the now with anxiety about a future event. If the event becomes the now, the anxiety, by definition, must go.
- Tackle problems…with action now! Do it! The only thing holding you back is you, and the neurotic choices you’ve made
- Start using your mind creatively in what were previously boring circumstances.
- When someone begins to criticize you, ask this question, “Do you think I need a critic now?” Or when you find yourself being a critic, ask the person in your company if he wants to hear your citicism, and if so, why? This will help you to move from the critic to the doer column.
- Look hard at your life. Are you doing what you’d choose to be doing if you knew you had six months to live? If not, you’d better begin doing it... ...Your total lifetime is a mere speck. Delaying anything makes no sense.
- Be courageous about undertaking an activity that you’ve been avoiding. One act of courage can eliminate all that fear. Stop telling yourself that you must perform well. Remind yourself that doing it is far more important.
- Decide not to be tired until the moment before you get into bed. Don’t allow yourself to use fatigue or illness as an escape or to put off doing anything... ...when you take away the reason for the illness or exhaustion—that is, avoidance of a task—physical problems “magically” disappear.
- Eliminate the words “hope,” “wish” and “maybe” from your vocabulary. They are the tools of putting it off... ...“I hope things will work out” to “I will make it happen.” “I wish things were better” to “I am going to do the following things to ensure that I feel better.” “Maybe it will be okay” to “I will make it okay.”
- If you are putting something off which involves others... ...have a conference with all involved and ask their opinions... ...By enlisting the aid of a confidant to help you with your procrastination, you’ll have made it a joint effort. Soon you’ll dissipate much of the anxiousness that goes along with procrastination by sharing that as well.
- Write a contract with your loved ones in which you will deliver the goods you want to but which you may have been postponing. Have each party keep a copy of the contract, and build in penalties for defaulting... ...you’ll find this strategy helpful and personally rewarding, since you’ll be participating in events that you also find enjoyable.

If you want the world to change, don’t complain about it. Do something.

Rather than using up your present moments with all kinds of immobilizing anxiety over what you are putting off, take charge... ...and live now!

Be a doer, not a wisher, hoper or critic.


## 10 Declare Your Independence

In any relationship in which two people become one, the end result is two half people.

Leaving the psychological nest is one of life’s difficult chores.

Psychological independence means total freedom from all obligatory relationships, and an absence of other-directed behavior.

The nest-leaving business is especially difficult because our society teaches us to fulfill certain expectations in special relationships.

Leaving the nest means becoming your own person, living and choosing the behaviors that you want.

If you enjoy your way of interacting with anyone and it doesn’t interfere with your own goals, then it is something you can cherish rather than change.

Psychological dependence... ...means that you are in relationships that involve no choice, a relationship in which you are obliged to be something you don’t want to be and that you resent the way in which you are being forced to conduct yourself.

If you want some kind of relationship, then it is not unhealthy. But if you need it, or are forced into it, and subsequently feel resentment, then you are in a self-defeating area.

Obligation breeds guilt and dependency, while choice fosters love and independence.

There is no choice in a psychologically dependent relationship, consequently there will always be indignation and ill-feelings in any such alliance.

The moment you need, you become vulnerable, a slave. If the one you need leaves... ...you are then forced into immobilization,

Society teaches us to be psychologically dependent on a whole raft of folks from parents on.

As long as you feel that you have to do anything because it is expected of you in a particular relationship, and your doing it creates any resentment or your not doing it any guilt, you can count yourself as having work to do in this erroneous zone.

Eliminating dependency starts with your family, with the way your parents dealt with you as a child and the way you deal with your own children today.

### The Dependency Trap in Child Rearing and the Family

Throughout the animal kingdom, parenting means to teach the offspring the skills necessary to be independent and then to leave. With us humans, the instinct is still the same, that is, to be independent, but the neurotic need to own and live one’s life through one’s children seems to take over, and the goal of raising a child to be independent is subverted into the idea of raising a child to hold onto him.

You want for your children... ...to be high in self-esteem and self-confidence... ...But how can you help to ensure such an outcome? Only by being that way yourself.

Children learn from the behavior of their models.

If you model low self-esteem, then you’ll teach your children to adopt the same attitudes for themselves.

You cannot hand your children self-confidence; they must acquire it by seeing you living the same way yourself.

Only by treating yourself as the most important person and not always sacrificing yourself for your children will you teach them to have their own self-confidence and belief in themselves.

If you are a sacrificer, you are... ...modeling sacrificing behavior.

While doing for others is sometimes admirable, if it is at the expense of yourself, you are merely teaching the others the same kind of resentment-breeding behavior.

When guilt and fear of disappointment color the nest-leaving, they continue throughout life, sometimes to the point that the marriage relationship becomes one of parenting, rather than of two individuals sharing on an equal footing.

The family is an important unit in the developmental process, but it should not be a permanent unit.
up.

As you examine effective parent-child relationships which have no requirements or obligations attached, you’ll discover parents who treat their children as friends.

No abuse because they are owned, but a respect for the child’s dignity.

### Differences Between Dependent and Independent Focused Families

In families that focus on independence, movement toward being one’s own person is seen as normal, rather than as a challenge to anyone’s authority.

The result is family members who want to be together, rather than feel obligated to be together.

In this sort of family there is no subtle manipulation via guilt or threats to keep the children dependent and responsible to the parents. As the children mature, the parents don’t want their kids to visit them out of obligation. Besides, the parents are too busy being effective in their own way to be sitting around waiting for children and grandchildren to show up and give them a reason for living.

> Sooner or later each of us must take the step that separates him from his father, from his mentors; each of us must have some cruelly lonely experience…I myself had not parted from my parents and their world, the “luminous” world in a violent struggle, but had gradually and almost imperceptibly become estranged. I was sad that it had to be this way, and it made for many unpleasant hours.
> -Hesse’s Demian talks about the variety of paths to independence.

> A mother is not a person to lean on, but a person to make leaning unnecessary.
> -HDorothy Canfield Fisher, Her Son’s Wife

You can make nest-leaving a natural event, or one which is loaded with trauma and which will haunt the child and the relationship forever.

### Psychological Dependence and Marriage Crisis

If you’re... ...left one dependent relationship with your parents and entered into another when you married, then you have an erroneous zone that needs work.

> Marriage is that relation between man and woman in which the independence is equal, the dependence mutual, and the obligation reciprocal.
> -Louis Anspacher wrote about marriage in America

A relationship based on love, as was said earlier, is one in which each partner allows the other to be what he chooses, with no expectations and no demands.

This sort of relationship is so rare in our culture that it is almost mythological. Imagine a union with the one you love, in which each of you can be whatever you desire. Now consider the reality of most relationships. How does that grisly dependency sneak in and muck up the works?

### A Typical Marriage

With two self-reliant people, who care enough about each other to foster independence rather than dependence, but at the same time share happiness with a loved person, marriage can be an exciting prospect. But, when two people try to merge into oneness, or one tries to dominate the other in any way, that spark that is within us all fights for one of the greatest human needs, independence.

Longevity is not an indication of success in marriage. Many people stay married out of fear of the unknown, or because of inertia, or simply because it is the thing to do.

### You Are Treated the Way You Teach Others to Treat You

Dependency is not something that just happens because of association with domineering people. It is... ...a choice.

You teach people to dominate you, and to treat you the way you’ve always been treated.

Common strategies for maintaining dominance and control threads:

- Yelling, screaming and voice-raising of any kind. This will keep you in line if you are a soft person and want things quiet and smooth.
- Inducement of guilt. “You had no right to—”... ...If guilt is your hang-up, then you can be kept “submissive” with such statements.
- The use of anger and explosive behavior.
- The physical ailment ploy... ...when one partner doesn’t act the way the other wants him to.
- The silent treatment. No talking and deliberate sulking are superlative strategies that one partner can use to maneuver the other into correct behavior.
- Cry in order to help the other person to feel guilty.
- The leaving scene.
- The suicide scheme.

If one partner refuses to be manipulated by them, the other will not continue to use them.

If you give the proper submissive reactions, you are teaching the other what you will tolerate.

You can learn to teach others to treat you the way you want to be treated. It will take time and effort because it has taken a lot of time to teach others how you wanted to be treated until now.

Rather than saying, “Why don’t you treat me better?” begin to say, “What am I doing to teach others to treat me this way?” Put the focus on you, and begin changing those reactions.

### Some Common Dependency and Dependency-Fostering

- Feeling unable to leave the nest or leaving it with bad feelings on both sides.
- Asking permission... ...for anything,
- Invasions of privacy.
- Falling into depression and immobilization after the death of a loved one.
- Feeling committed to a particular job and never venturing out on your own.
- Having expectations for how a spouse, parent, or child has to be.
- Being in _training_ all of your life for a job or position. Never leaving the training phase for self-reliance.
- Being hurt by what others say, feel, think, or do.
- Taking orders from someone.
- Allowing someone else to make decisions for you, or always asking advice before deciding.
- Not doing something in front of a parent or dominant person because they wouldn’t approve.
- Giving up on your own life when a loved one dies, or becomes seriously ill.
- Using careful language around a dominant person, so that he won’t be upset with you.
- Persistently lying about your own behavior, and having to distort the truth so that “they” won’t be upset with you.

### The Psychological Compensation of Dependency

You may know the payoffs for being a dependent, but do you know how destructive they are? Dependency may appear harmless, but it is the enemy of all happiness and fulfillment.

- Being dependent can keep you in the protective custody of others, and give you the little child benefits of not being responsible for your own behavior.
- By staying dependent, you can blame your shortcomings on others.
- If you are dependent on others, you don’t have to undertake the hard work and risk of change. You are secure in your reliance on others who will take responsibility for you.
- You can feel good about yourself because you are pleasing others.
- You can avoid guilt which you choose when you behave assertively. It is easier to behave than to learn to eliminate guilt.
- You needn’t make choices or decisions for yourself... ...So long as you think what they think or feel what they feel, there’s no need for the hard work of determining what you think or feel.
- When everything else is boiled away, it is just plain easier to be a follower than a leader. You can do what you’re told and avoid trouble, even though you may not like the way you feel as a follower. It’s still simpler than taking all those risks that go with being your own person. Dependency is distasteful because it makes you into less than a whole, independently functioning person. But it is easier, that’s for sure.

### A Prospectus for Ridding Yourself of Dependency

- Write your own Declaration of Independence in which you spell out for yourself how you want to function in all relationships, not eliminating compromise, but wiping out any manipulation without representation.
- Talk with each person that you feel you are psychologically dependent upon... ...This is an excellent strategy for getting started, because the other may not even be aware of how you feel as a dependent.
- Give yourself five-minute goals for how you’re going to deal with dominant people in your life.
- Arrange a planning session with your dominant partner at a time when you are feeling unthreatened. During this session, explain that you sometimes feel manipulated and submissive and that you would like to arrange a nonverbal signal to let the other person know how you are feeling when it crops up, but that you don’t want to discuss it at that time.
- At the moment you are feeling shoved-around psychologically, state how you feel to the person, and then act out the way you’d like to behave.
- Remind yourself that... ...others will often disapprove of your behavior, and that has nothing to do with who or what you are... ...If you expect it, then you won’t be thrown by it.
- Even if you are deliberately avoiding dominant people... ...you are still being controlled by them in their absence if you are experiencing emotional immobilization because of them.
- If you are feeling obligated to visit certain people, ask yourself if you would want others to visit you simply because they felt required to do so.
- Make a decision to get out of your dependency role by doing volunteer work... ...getting a job that doesn’t necessarily even pay well... ...the remuneration of your own high self-esteem is worth whatever the price it costs in money or time.
- Insist on financial independence with no strings, and no accounting to anyone. You are a slave if you must ask for money.
- Let them go! Let yourself go! Stop giving orders! Stop taking orders!
- Recognize your desire for privacy and not having to share everything you feel and experience with someone.
- Let a child’s room be his... ...A made bed is not any more psychologically sound than an unmade bed, even though you may have learned the opposite.
- At a party, congregate with people away from your partner... ...Split up and then join forces when it is over. You’ll double your learning and experience.
- Take mini-trips alone, or with friends without having to feel attached to your partner. You’ll feel more strongly toward your partner when you come back, and you’ll treasure your independent functioning as well.
- Keep in mind that you have no responsibility to make others happy. Others make themselves happy... ...You are responsible for your own emotions and so is everyone else. No one has control over your feelings, except you.
- Remember that habit is no reason to do anything. Just because you’ve always been submissive to others is not sufficient justification for allowing it to continue.

The business of effective living and parenting is independence.

And while you may feel real fear about breaking away from dependent relationships, if you asked those upon whom you are emotionally dependent, you would surprisingly discover that they most admire those who think and act for themselves. More irony. You get the most respect for being independent, particularly from those who try the hardest to keep you subordinate.

The nest is a beautiful place for a child to develop, but nest-leaving is even more beautiful and can be viewed that way by the one leaving, as well as the one watching the takeoff.

## 11 Farewell to Anger

The only antidote to anger is to eliminate the internal sentence, “If only you were more like me.”

But anger is probably a part of you that you don’t like, and needless to say, neither does anyone else.

Anger... ...serves no purpose that has anything to do with being a happy, fulfilled person. It is an erroneous zone, a kind of psychological influenza that incapacitates you just as a physical disease would.

_anger_... ...refers to an immobilizing reaction, experienced when any expectancy is not met. Takes the form of rage, hostility, striking out at someone or even glowering silence.

Anger is immobilizing and it is usually a result of wishing the world and the people in it were different.

Anger is a choice, as well as a habit. It is a learned reaction to frustration, in which you behave in ways that you would rather not.

Anger is debilitating. In the physiological realm, it can produce hypertension, ulcers, rashes, heart palpitations, insomnia, fatigue and even heart disease. In the psychological sense, anger breaks down love relationships, interferes with communication, leads to guilt and depression and generally just gets in your way.

The expression of anger is indeed a healthier alternative than suppressing it. But there is an even healthier stance—not having the anger at all.

Like all emotions, anger is the result of thinking. It is not something that simply happens to you.

When faced with circumstances that are not going the way you would like them to, you tell yourself that things shouldn’t be that way (frustration) and then you select a familiar angry response which serves a purpose.

As long as you think of anger as a part of what it means to be a human being, you have a reason to accept it, and avoid going to work on it.

By all means give vent to your anger, let it out in nondestructive ways—if you are still deciding to have it. But begin to think of yourself as someone who can learn to think new thoughts when you are frustrated, so that the immobilizing anger can be replaced by more fulfilling emotions. 

Annoyance, irritation, and disappointment are feelings that you will very likely continue to experience, since the world will never be the way you want it. But anger, that hurtful emotional response to obstacles, can be eliminated.

Select personal strategies that will reinforce appropriate behavior, but don’t take all of the internal hurt that goes with it.
