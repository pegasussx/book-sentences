## Introduction — A Personal Statement

A speaker stood before a group of alcoholics determined to demonstrate to them, once and for all, that alcohol was an evil beyond compare. On the platform he had what appeared to be two identical containers of clear fluid. He announced that one contained pure water and the other was filled with undiluted alcohol. He placed a small worm in the container while everyone watched as it swam around and headed for the side of the glass, whereupon it simply crawled to the top of the glass. He then took the same worm and placed it in the container with alcohol. The worm disintegrated right before their eyes. “There,” said the speaker. “What’s the moral?” A voice from the rear of the room said quite clearly, “I see that if you drink alcohol, you’ll never have worms.”

This book has a lot of “worms”... ...you will hear and perceive exactly what you want to hear based upon many of your own values.

Looking at yourself in depth with an eye toward changing might be something that you say you are interested in accomplishing, but your behavior often speaks otherwise.

Change is tough.

Mental health should be treated in a flip manner, neither... ...it must be a humorless enterprise... ...I have tried to avoid intricate explanations, because I do not believe that “being happy” is a complex affair.

Being healthy is a natural state, and the means for achieving it are within the grasp of each one of us.

Hard work, clear thinking, humor and self-confidence are the ingredients of effective living.

You don’t need a professional background in counseling and a doctorate in the helping professions to understand the principles of effective living... ...You learn them by being committed to your own happiness and by doing something about it... ...every day.

Each chapter of this book is written like a counseling session... ...A particular erroneous zone, or kind of self-destructive behavior, is explored, and the historical antecedents for the behavior in our culture (and therefore in you) are examined.

Helping you understand _why_ you are trapped in this self-defeating zone.

Behaviors that fall into this erroneous zone are detailed... ...that may seem perfectly acceptable, but are, in reality, harmful to your own happiness.

After a look at the behaviors... ...examination of the _reasons_ for hanging onto behavior which does not make you happy... ...look at the psychological support system that you have erected to maintain self- defeating behavior, rather than giving it up.

Answer the questions, “What do I get out of my behavior?” and “Why does it persist if it is injurious to me?”

The reasons for keeping neurotic behavior are fairly consistent across all of the erroneous zones.

It is safer to hang onto a learned response, even if it is self-destructive. Moreover, you can eliminate having to change and take responsibility if you keep the erroneous zones intact.

Your psychological maintenance system functions to keep blame off you and the opportunity for change at bay.

The fact that you maintain many self-defeating behaviors for the same reason only makes total growth more approachable. Eliminate these reasons and you’ll eradicate your erroneous zones.

Each chapter concludes with some straightforward strategies for eliminating self-nullifying behavior.

Counseling session is all about... ...exploration of the... ...self-defeating behavior,... ...the “Why” of the behavior and concrete strategies for eliminating the troublesome area.

Effective thinking—thinking which can alter self-destructive behavior— does not occur just because something is said. An insight must be repeated, and repeated, and repeated again. Only then, when it is fully accepted and understood, do you begin to alter behavior.

Two central themes... ...The first involves your ability to make choices about your own emotions.

Begin to examine your life in the light of choices you have made or failed to make. This puts all responsibility for what you are and how you feel on you.

Becoming happier and more effective will mean becoming more aware of the choices that are available to you.

YOU ARE THE SUM TOTAL OF YOUR CHOICES.

With an appropriate amount of motivation and effort you can be anything you choose.

The second theme... ...taking charge of your present moments.

There is only one moment in which you can experience anything, and that is now, yet a great deal of time is thrown away by dwelling on past or future experiences.

Turning your now into total fulfillment is the touchstone of effective living, and virtually all self-defeating behaviors (erroneous zones) are efforts at living in a moment other than the current one.

Choice and present-moment living will be stressed on almost every page of this book.

You’ll soon begin to ask yourself... ...“Why am I choosing to feel upset right now?” and “How can I make more effective use of my present moments?”... ...moving away from erroneous zones toward self- reliance and happiness.

Twenty-five questions designed to measure your capacity to choose happiness and fulfillment... ...assess yourself and how you live your present moments. “Yes” responses indicate personal mastery and effective choice-making.

At any given moment of your life, you can choose to say yes to all of the questions above if you are willing to repeal many “shoulds” and “oughts” that you have learned throughout your life.

The real choice is whether you decide to be personally free or remain chained to the expectations that others have of you.

> I want to travel as far as I can go, I want to reach the joy that’s in my soul, And change the limitations that I know, And feel my mind and spirit grow; I want to live, exist, “to be,” And hear the truths inside of me.
> —Doris Warshay. New Directions poem

This book will help you to eliminate any “worms”... ...that may be keeping you from beautiful new experiences and to discover and choose your own new directions.

## 1 Taking Charge of Yourself

The essence of greatness is the ability to choose personal fulfillment in circumstances where others choose madness.

A constant companion... ...call him _Your-Own-Death._ You can fear this visitor or use him for your personal gain. The choice is up to you.

“Should I avoid doing the things I really want to do?” “Should I live my life as others want me to?” “Are things important to accumulate?” “Is putting it off the way to live?”... ...answers can be summed up in a few words: Live...Be You...Enjoy...Love.

The next time you are contemplating a decision in which you are debating whether or not to... ...make your own choice, ask yourself an important question, “How long am I going to be dead?”... ...make your own choice and leave the worrying... ...to those who are going to be alive forever.

If you don’t begin taking these steps, you can anticipate living your entire life the way others say you must.

It’s your life; do with it what _you_ want.

### Happiness and Your Own I.Q.

Taking charge of yourself involves putting to rest some very prevalent myths.

Intelligence is measured by your ability to solve complex problems... ...This vision of intelligence... ...encourages a kind of intellectual snobbery that has brought with it some demoralizing results.

A truer barometer of intelligence is an effective, happy life lived each day and each present moment of every day.

If you are happy, if you live each moment for everything it’s worth, then you are an intelligent person.

Problem solving is a useful adjunct to your happiness, but if you know that given your inability to resolve a particular concern you can still choose happiness for yourself, or at a minimum refuse to choose unhappiness, then you are intelligent.

You are intelligent because you have the ultimate weapon against the big N.B.D. Yep—_N_ervous _B_reak _D_own.

“Intelligent” people do not have N.B.D.’s because they are in charge of themselves. They know how to choose happiness over depression, because they know how to deal with the _problems_ of their lives.

I didn’t say _solve_ the problems. Rather than measuring their intelligence on their ability to _solve_ the problem, they measure it on their capacity for maintaining themselves as happy and worthy, whether the problem gets solved or not.

You can begin to think of yourself as truly intelligent on the basis of how you choose to feel in the face of trying circumstances.

The life struggles are pretty much the same for each of us... ...Disagreements, conflicts and compromises are a part of what it means to be human.

Some people are able to... ...avoid immobilizing dejection and unhappiness... ...while others collapse.

Those who recognize problems as a human condition and don’t measure happiness by an absence of problems are the most intelligent kind of humans we know; also, the most rare.

Learning to take total charge of yourself will involve a whole new thinking process... ...difficult because too many forces in our society conspire against individual responsibility.

You must trust in your own ability to feel emotionally whatever you choose to feel at any time in your life.

You’ve grown up believing that you can’t control your own emotions; that anger, fear and hate, as well as love, ecstasy and joy are things that happen to you. An individual doesn’t control these things, he accepts them... ...and hope that some happy events will come along so that you can feel good very soon.

### Choosing How You’ll Feel

Feelings are not just emotions that happen to you. Feelings are reactions you choose to have.

If you are in charge of your own emotions, you don’t have to choose self-defeating reactions.

You can feel what you choose to feel.

The road to “intelligence”... ...will be new because you’ll see a given emotion as a choice rather than as a condition of life. This is the very heart and soul of personal freedom.

Attack the myth of not being in charge of your emotions through logic.

Syllogism (a formulation in logic, in which you have a major premise, a minor premise and a conclusion based upon the agreement between the two premises).

Logic—Syllogism
MAJOR PREMISE: Aristotle is a Man. MINOR PREMISE: All men have facial hair. CONCLUSION: ARISTOTLE HAS FACIAL HAIR.

Illogic—Syllogism 
MAJOR PREMISE: Aristotle has facial hair. MINOR PREMISE: All men have facial hair. CONCLUSION: ARISTOTLE IS A MAN.

In the second illustration, Aristotle could be an ape or a mole.

logical exercise that can forever put to rest the notion that you cannot take charge of your own emotional world. MAJOR PREMISE: I can control my thoughts. MINOR PREMISE: My feelings come from my thoughts. CONCLUSION: I can control my feelings.

I can say to you, “Think of a pink antelope,” and you can turn it green, or make it an aardvark, or simply think of something else if you so choose.

You alone control what enters your head as a thought.

No one else can get inside your head and have your own thoughts as you experience them. You do indeed control your thoughts, and your brain is your own to use as you so determine.

You cannot have a feeling (emotion) without first having experienced a thought. Take away your brain and your ability to “feel” is wiped out.

A feeling is a physical reaction to a thought.

Every feeling that you have was preceded by a thought, and without a brain you can have no feelings.

If you control your thoughts, and your feelings come from your thoughts, then you are capable of controlling your own feelings. And you control your feelings by working on the thoughts that preceded them.

You make yourself unhappy because of the thoughts that you have about the people or things in your life.

Becoming a free and healthy person involves learning to _think_ differently.

Once you can change your thoughts, your new feelings will begin to emerge, and you will have taken the first step on the road to your personal freedom.

Cal, a young executive who spends most of his time agonizing over the fact that his boss thinks he is stupid... ...Cal makes himself unhappy by convincing himself that what someone else thinks is more important than what he thinks.

Someone’s death does not make you unhappy; you cannot be unhappy until you learn of the death, so it’s not the death but what you tell yourself about the event.

Ask yourself, “Why should I choose depression? Will it help me to be more effective in dealing with it?”

You have grown up in a culture which has taught you that you are not responsible for your feelings even though the syllogistic truth is that you always were. You’ve learned a host of sayings to defend yourself against the fact that you do control your feelings.

- "You hurt my feelings."
- "You make me feel bad."
- "I can’t help the way I feel."
- "I just feel angry, don’t ask me to explain it." 
- "He makes me sick."
- "Heights scare me."
- "You’re embarrassing me."
- "She really turns me on."
- "You made a fool of me in public."

Rewrite the list so it is accurate, so it reflects the fact that you are in charge of how you feel and that your feelings come from the thoughts you have about anything.

- "I hurt my feelings because of the things I told myself about your reaction to me."
- "I made myself feel bad."
- "I can help the way I feel, but I’ve chosen to be upset."
- "I’ve decided to be angry, because I can usually manipulate others with my   anger, since they think I control them." 
- "I make myself sick."
- "I scare myself at high places."
- "I’m embarrassing myself."
- "I turn myself on whenever I’m near her."
- "I made myself feel foolish by taking your opinions of me more seriously than my own, and believing that others would do the same."

Why the statements in List 2 did not evolve into clichés. The answer lies in our culture, which teaches the thinking of List 1, and discourages the logic of List 2.

You feel what you think, and you can learn to think differently about anything—if you decide to do so.

Ask yourself if there is a sufficient payoff in being unhappy, down, or hurt. Then begin to examine, in depth, the kind of thoughts that are leading you to these debilitating feelings.

### Learning Not To Be Unhappy: A Tough Assignment

It is not easy to think in new ways. You are accustomed to a certain set of thoughts and the debilitating thoughts that follow.

Happiness is easy, but learning not to be unhappy can be difficult.

Happiness is a natural condition of being a person. The evidence is plainly visible when you look at young children.

Taking charge of yourself begins with awareness.

Catch yourself when you say things like, “He hurt my feelings.”... ...New thinking requires awareness of the old thinking.

You have become habituated in mental patterns that identify the causes of your feelings as outside of yourself... ...you’ll need to balance the scale with thousands of hours of new... ...thinking that assumes responsibility for your own feelings. It is tough, damn tough; but so what? That certainly is no reason to avoid doing it.

_Awareness,_ and then after thousands of trials, mistakes, new efforts.

You’ve learned the habits you now have by reinforcing them all of your life.

You have accepted your behavior and never worked at challenging it. But you can learn to not be unhappy, angry, hurt, or frustrated just as you learned to be all those self-defeating things.

A thought becomes a belief when you’ve worked on it repeatedly, not when you simply try it once and use your initial inability as the rationale for giving up.

Taking charge of yourself involves more than simply trying on new thoughts for size. It requires a determination to be happy and to challenge and destroy each and every thought that creates a self-immobilizing unhappiness in you.

### Choice—Your Ultimate Freedom

If you still believe that you don’t choose to be unhappy, try to imagine this course of events. Each time you become unhappy you are subjected to some treatment you find unpleasant... ...How long do you think you would continue to hold on to them? Chances are you would take control rather quickly.

The issue is not whether you can take control of your feelings, but whether you will.

What must you endure before you’ll make such a choice? Some people choose to go insane rather than take control. Others merely give up and succumb to a life of misery because the dividend of pity received is greater than the reward of being happy.

The issue here is your own ability to choose happiness or at least not to choose unhappiness.

To discard it is to give up on yourself.

Just as you are free to choose happiness over unhappiness... ...you are free to choose self-fulfilling behavior over self- defeating behavior.

Substitute in slow progressive steps healthy new feelings and habits for old self- defeating emotions.

You can choose to make any experience enjoyable and challenging. Dull parties and committee meetings are fertile territory for choosing new feelings.

When you find yourself bored, you can make your mind work in exciting ways, by changing the subject with a key observation, or writing the first chapter of your novel, or working on new plans which will help you to avoid these settings in the future.

Using your mind actively means assessing the people and events which give you the greatest difficulty and then deciding on new mental efforts to make them work for you.

Think first of why you should not choose to be upset because someone or something is not going the way you would like it to go.

Don’t just get perturbed. Use your brain to work for you, and eventually you’ll have the terrific habit of not being upset when things go wrong.

### Choosing Health Over Illness

You can also choose to eliminate some physical sufferings which are not rooted in a known organic dysfunction.

There is a burgeoning amount of evidence to support the notion that people even choose things like tumors... ...and many other infirmities, including cancer, which have always been considered something that just happens to people.

Helping the patient not to want the disease... ...may be a means of ameliorating the internal killer.

The human brain can store an amount of information equivalent to one hundred trillion words, and all of us use but a tiny fraction of this storage space.

It’s not uncommon for individuals to become mysteriously sick when confronted with some kind of difficult circumstance, or to avoid illness when being sick is simply “impossible” at that time, and so postponed the effects, perhaps the fever, until the big event is over, and then collapse.

Listen to the advertisements we see and hear on television. “I’m a stockbroker.... So you can imagine the tension and headaches I must have. I take this pill to make it go away.” Message: You can’t control how you feel if you work in certain kinds of jobs (teachers, executives, parents) so rely on something else to do it for you. We are bombarded with messages like this every day.

We are helpless prisoners who must have someone or something else do things for us. NONSENSE. Only you can improve your lot or make yourself happy.

It is up to you to take control of your own mind, and then practice feeling and behaving in the ways that you choose.
