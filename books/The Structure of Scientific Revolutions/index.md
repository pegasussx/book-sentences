## Introductory Essay by Ian Hacking

Great books are rare.

The Essential Tension is a superb collection of philosophical (as opposed to historical) papers that he published immediately before or soon after Structure.1 It can be thought of as a series of commentaries and expansions, so it is excellent companion reading.

like all great books, this is a work of passion and a passionate desire to get things right.

Thomas Kuhn was out to change our understanding of the sciences—that is, of the activities that have enabled our species, for better or worse, to dominate the planet. He succeeded.

### 1962

Nineteen sixty-two was a long time ago... ...The queen of the sciences, then, was physics. Kuhn had been trained as a physicist. Few people knew much physics, but everybody knew that physics was where the action was. A cold war was in progress, so everyone knew about the Bomb. American schoolchildren had to practice cowering under their desks. At least once a year towns sounded an air raid siren, at which everyone had to take shelter. Those who protested against a nuclear weapon, by ostentatiously not taking shelter, could be arrested, and some were. Bob Dylan first performed “A Hard Rain’s A-Gonna Fall” in September 1962; everyone assumed it was about nuclear fallout. In October 1962 there was the Cuban Missile Crisis, the closest the world has come, after 1945, to nuclear war. Physics and its threat were on everyone’s mind.

Another event of 1962 was the awarding of Nobel prizes to Francis Crick and James Watson for the molecular biology of DNA and to Max Perutz and John Kendrew for the molecular biology of hemoglobin. That was the harbinger of change. Today, biotechnology rules.

You will have to decide, after reading his book, about the extent to which what he said about the physical sciences holds true in the teeming, present world

Experiment is not what it was, for it has been modified and to a certain extent replaced by computer simulation.

In 1962 there were competing cosmologies: steady state and big bang, two completely different pictures of the universe and its origin. After 1965 and the almost fortuitous discovery of universal background radiation, there is only the big bang, full of outstanding problems pursued as normal science.

As he reorganized his own past, he increasingly presented himself as always having had primarily philosophical interests.9 Although Structure had an immense immediate impact on the community of historians of science, its more enduring effects have probably been upon philosophy of science and, indeed, on public culture. That is the perspective from which this introduction is written.

### Structure

He had a gift for aphorism; and his names have acquired an unusual status, for although they were once arcane, some of them are now part of colloquial English.

That is the structure of scientific revolutions: normal science with a paradigm and a dedication to solving puzzles; followed by serious anomalies, which lead to a crisis; and finally resolution of the crisis by a new paradigm.

Incommensurability. This is the idea that, in the course of a revolution and paradigm shift, the new ideas and assertions cannot be strictly compared to the old ones. Even if the same words are in use, their very meaning has changed. That in turn led to the idea that a new theory was not chosen to replace an old one, because it was true but more because of a change in world view 

Progress in science is not a simple line leading to the truth. It is more progress away from less adequate conceptions of, and interactions with, the world

### Revolution

Immanuel Kant. He saw two great intellectual revolutions... ...One was the transition in mathematical practice in which techniques familiar in Babylonia and Egypt were transformed in Greece to proofs from postulates. The second was the emergence of the experimental method and the laboratory, a series of events that he identified as beginning with Galileo.

He had proposed that there was a “second scientific revolution.”15 It took place during the early years of the nineteenth century; whole new fields were mathematized. Heat, light, electricity, and magnetism acquired paradigms, and suddenly a whole mass of unsorted phenomena began to make sense. This coincided with—went hand-in-with—what we call the industrial revolution. It was arguably the beginning of the modern technoscientific world in which we live.

Einstein’s special (1905) and then general (1916) theory of relativity were more shattering events than we can well conceive. Relativity had, at the beginning, far more repercussions in the humanities and arts than genuine testable consequences in physics. Yes, there was the famous expedition of Sir Arthur Eddington to test an astronomical prediction of the theory, but it was only later that relativity became integral to many branches of physics.

The quantum revolution, also a two-stage affair, with Max Planck’s introduction of quanta around 1900 and then the full quantum theory of 1926–27, complete with Heisenberg’s uncertainty principle. Combined, relativity and quantum physics overthrew not only old science but basic metaphysics.

Before Kuhn, Karl Popper (1902–94) was the most influential philosopher of science—I mean the most widely read, and to some extent believed, by practicing scientists.16 Popper had come of age during the second quantum revolution. It taught him that science proceeds by conjectures and refutations, to use the title of one of his books. 

First we frame bold conjectures, as testable as possible, and inevitably find them wanting. They are refuted, and a new conjecture must be found that fits the facts. Hypotheses can count as “scientific” only if they are falsifiable. This purist vision of science would have been unthinkable before the great turn-of-the-century revolutions.

The sciences look different today. In 2009 the 150th anniversary of Darwin’s The Origin of Species by Means of Natural Selection was celebrated with great fanfare. With all the books, shows, and festivals, I suspect that many bystanders, if asked what was the most revolutionary scientific work of all time, would very reasonably have answered The Origin of Species. So it is striking that Darwin’s revolution is never mentioned in Structure. Natural selection does enter in an important way on pages 171–72 but only to serve as analogy to scientific development. Now that the life sciences have replaced physics as top dog, we have to ask about the extent to which Darwin’s revolution fits Kuhn’s template.

I regret the recent debasing of revolution to mere hype, but it is a fact that makes the comprehension of Kuhn a little more difficult.

A single sentence of page 35 sums up Kuhn’s doctrine: “The most striking feature of the normal research problems we have just encountered is how little they aim to produce major novelties, conceptual or phenomenal.”

If you look at any research journal, he wrote, you will find three types of problems addressed: (1) determination of significant facts, (2) matching of facts with theory, and (3) articulation of theory. To expand slightly:

1. Theory leaves certain quantities or phenomena inadequately described and only qualitatively tells us what to expect. Measurement and other procedures determine the facts more precisely.
2. Known observations don’t quite tally with theory. What’s wrong? Tidy up the theory or show that the experimental data were defective.
3. The theory may have a solid mathematical formulation, but one is not yet able to comprehend its consequences. Kuhn gives the apt name of articulation to the process of bringing out what is implicit in the theory, often by mathematical analysis.

Since the 1980s there has been a substantial shift in emphasis, with historians, sociologists, and philosophers attending seriously to experimental science.

Immense experimental or instrumental novelty is simply missed in Kuhn’s theoretical stance, so normal science may have a great deal of novelty, just not theoretical. And for the general public, which wants technologies and cures, the novelties for which science is admired are usually not theoretical at all. That is why Kuhn’s remark sounds somehow wrongheaded.

In Kuhn’s idea of normal science, notice that the high-energy physics most widely reported by science journalists is the search for the Higgs particle. This involves an incredible treasury of both money and talent, all of which is dedicated to confirming what present physics teaches—that there is an as yet undetected particle that plays an essential role in the very existence of matter.

In one sense, nothing new in the way of theory or even phenomena is anticipated. That’s what Kuhn was right about. Normal science does not aim at novelty. But novelty can emerge from confirmation of theories already held. 

it is hoped that when the right conditions for eliciting the particle are finally established, an entire new generation of high-energy physics will begin.

### Paradigm (§V)

Kuhn single-handedly changed the currency of the word paradigm so that a new reader attaches very different connotations to the word than were available to the author in 1962.

Nowadays paradigm, along with its companion paradigm shift, is embarrassingly everywhere.

Today, it is pretty hard to escape the damn word, which is why Kuhn wrote even in 1970 that he had lost control of it.

The Greek word paradeigma played an important part in Aristotle’s theory of argument, especially in the book called Rhetoric. That book is about practical argument between two parties, an orator and an audience, who share a great many beliefs that hardly need stating. In English translations the ancestor of our word paradigm is usually rendered as example, but Aristotle meant something more like exemplar, a very best and most instructive example. He thought that there are two basic types of arguments. One kind of argument is essentially deductive, but with many unstated premises. The other is essentially analogical.

In general: Something is in dispute. One states a compelling example about which almost everyone in the audience will agree—a paradigm. The implication is that what is in dispute is “just like that.”

In Latin translations of Aristotle, paradeigma became exemplum, which pursued its own career in mediaeval and renaissance theories of argument. The word paradigm was, however, conserved in modern European languages but largely divorced from rhetoric.

When schoolchildren had to learn Latin, they were told to conjugate to love—“I love,” “thou lovest,” “he/she/it loves”—as amo, amas, amat, and so on. That was the paradigm, the model to imitate with similar verbs. The primary use of the word paradigm was in connection with grammar, but it was always available as a metaphor.

You cannot claim we lack free will (for example), because we had to learn the use of the expression “free will” from examples, and they are the paradigms.

Moreover, the achievements are not just anything notable. They are

1.“sufficiently unprecedented to attract an enduring group of adherents” away from what has been going on. And
2.they are open-ended, with plenty of problems for the “redefined group of practitioners to resolve.”

Kuhn concluded: “Achievements that share these two characteristics I shall henceforth refer to as ‘paradigms’ ”

Paradigms are integral to normal science, and a normal science, practiced by a scientific community, continues as long as there is plenty to do, open problems which yield to research using methods (laws, instruments, etc.) acknowledged by the tradition.

All is well until the methods legitimated by the paradigm cannot cope with a cluster of anomalies; crisis results and persists until a new achievement redirects research and serves as a new paradigm. That is a paradigm shift.

Natural analogies and resemblances can be found within almost any group of items; a paradigm is not only an achievement but also a particular way of modeling future practice upon it.

One has to acquire an “ability to see resemblances between apparently disparate problems.”

Kuhn admitted in “Second Thoughts on Paradigms” that he was far too generous in his use of the word paradigm. So he distinguished two families of uses of the idea, one global and one local. The local uses are various types of exemplar. The global use focuses first on the idea of a scientific community.

There is no question about what a scientific community “is.” The question is what binds its members together as working in the same discipline.

What keeps the group together as a group? What will cause a group to divide into sects, or simply to fall apart? 

“What shared elements account for the relatively unproblematic character of professional communication and for the relative unanimity of professional judgment? To this question The Structure of Scientific Revolutions licenses the answer ‘a paradigm’ or ‘a set of paradigms.’”

In Structure, a normal science begins with an achievement that serves as paradigm. Before then we have a pre-paradigm period of speculation, for example early discussions of phenomena of heat, of magnetism, of electricity, before “the second scientific revolution” brought with it a wave of paradigms for these fields.

“Whatever paradigms may be, they are possessed by any scientific community, including the schools of the so-called preparadigm period.”

Second thoughts are not necessarily better than first thoughts.

### Anomaly (§VI)

Normal science does not aim at novelty but at clearing up the status quo. It tends to discover what it expects to discover. 

Discovery comes not when something goes right but when something is awry, a novelty that runs counter to what was expected. In short, what appears to be an anomaly.

The a in anomaly is the a that means ‘not’, as in ‘amoral’ or ‘atheist’. The nom is from the Greek word for ‘law’. Anomalies are contrary to lawlike regularities, more generally, contrary to expectations.

We have a tendency to see what we expect, even when it is not there.
