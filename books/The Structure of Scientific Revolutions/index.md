## Introductory Essay by Ian Hacking

Great books are rare.

The Essential Tension is a superb collection of philosophical (as opposed to historical) papers that he published immediately before or soon after Structure.1 It can be thought of as a series of commentaries and expansions, so it is excellent companion reading.

like all great books, this is a work of passion and a passionate desire to get things right.

Thomas Kuhn was out to change our understanding of the sciences—that is, of the activities that have enabled our species, for better or worse, to dominate the planet. He succeeded.

### 1962

Nineteen sixty-two was a long time ago... ...The queen of the sciences, then, was physics. Kuhn had been trained as a physicist. Few people knew much physics, but everybody knew that physics was where the action was. A cold war was in progress, so everyone knew about the Bomb. American schoolchildren had to practice cowering under their desks. At least once a year towns sounded an air raid siren, at which everyone had to take shelter. Those who protested against a nuclear weapon, by ostentatiously not taking shelter, could be arrested, and some were. Bob Dylan first performed “A Hard Rain’s A-Gonna Fall” in September 1962; everyone assumed it was about nuclear fallout. In October 1962 there was the Cuban Missile Crisis, the closest the world has come, after 1945, to nuclear war. Physics and its threat were on everyone’s mind.

Another event of 1962 was the awarding of Nobel prizes to Francis Crick and James Watson for the molecular biology of DNA and to Max Perutz and John Kendrew for the molecular biology of hemoglobin. That was the harbinger of change. Today, biotechnology rules.

You will have to decide, after reading his book, about the extent to which what he said about the physical sciences holds true in the teeming, present world

Experiment is not what it was, for it has been modified and to a certain extent replaced by computer simulation.

In 1962 there were competing cosmologies: steady state and big bang, two completely different pictures of the universe and its origin. After 1965 and the almost fortuitous discovery of universal background radiation, there is only the big bang, full of outstanding problems pursued as normal science.

As he reorganized his own past, he increasingly presented himself as always having had primarily philosophical interests.9 Although Structure had an immense immediate impact on the community of historians of science, its more enduring effects have probably been upon philosophy of science and, indeed, on public culture. That is the perspective from which this introduction is written.

### Structure

He had a gift for aphorism; and his names have acquired an unusual status, for although they were once arcane, some of them are now part of colloquial English.

That is the structure of scientific revolutions: normal science with a paradigm and a dedication to solving puzzles; followed by serious anomalies, which lead to a crisis; and finally resolution of the crisis by a new paradigm.

Incommensurability. This is the idea that, in the course of a revolution and paradigm shift, the new ideas and assertions cannot be strictly compared to the old ones. Even if the same words are in use, their very meaning has changed. That in turn led to the idea that a new theory was not chosen to replace an old one, because it was true but more because of a change in world view 

Progress in science is not a simple line leading to the truth. It is more progress away from less adequate conceptions of, and interactions with, the world

### Revolution

Immanuel Kant. He saw two great intellectual revolutions... ...One was the transition in mathematical practice in which techniques familiar in Babylonia and Egypt were transformed in Greece to proofs from postulates. The second was the emergence of the experimental method and the laboratory, a series of events that he identified as beginning with Galileo.

He had proposed that there was a “second scientific revolution.”15 It took place during the early years of the nineteenth century; whole new fields were mathematized. Heat, light, electricity, and magnetism acquired paradigms, and suddenly a whole mass of unsorted phenomena began to make sense. This coincided with—went hand-in-with—what we call the industrial revolution. It was arguably the beginning of the modern technoscientific world in which we live.

Einstein’s special (1905) and then general (1916) theory of relativity were more shattering events than we can well conceive. Relativity had, at the beginning, far more repercussions in the humanities and arts than genuine testable consequences in physics. Yes, there was the famous expedition of Sir Arthur Eddington to test an astronomical prediction of the theory, but it was only later that relativity became integral to many branches of physics.

The quantum revolution, also a two-stage affair, with Max Planck’s introduction of quanta around 1900 and then the full quantum theory of 1926–27, complete with Heisenberg’s uncertainty principle. Combined, relativity and quantum physics overthrew not only old science but basic metaphysics.

Before Kuhn, Karl Popper (1902–94) was the most influential philosopher of science—I mean the most widely read, and to some extent believed, by practicing scientists.16 Popper had come of age during the second quantum revolution. It taught him that science proceeds by conjectures and refutations, to use the title of one of his books. 

First we frame bold conjectures, as testable as possible, and inevitably find them wanting. They are refuted, and a new conjecture must be found that fits the facts. Hypotheses can count as “scientific” only if they are falsifiable. This purist vision of science would have been unthinkable before the great turn-of-the-century revolutions.

The sciences look different today. In 2009 the 150th anniversary of Darwin’s The Origin of Species by Means of Natural Selection was celebrated with great fanfare. With all the books, shows, and festivals, I suspect that many bystanders, if asked what was the most revolutionary scientific work of all time, would very reasonably have answered The Origin of Species. So it is striking that Darwin’s revolution is never mentioned in Structure. Natural selection does enter in an important way on pages 171–72 but only to serve as analogy to scientific development. Now that the life sciences have replaced physics as top dog, we have to ask about the extent to which Darwin’s revolution fits Kuhn’s template.

I regret the recent debasing of revolution to mere hype, but it is a fact that makes the comprehension of Kuhn a little more difficult.

A single sentence of page 35 sums up Kuhn’s doctrine: “The most striking feature of the normal research problems we have just encountered is how little they aim to produce major novelties, conceptual or phenomenal.”

If you look at any research journal, he wrote, you will find three types of problems addressed: (1) determination of significant facts, (2) matching of facts with theory, and (3) articulation of theory. To expand slightly:

1. Theory leaves certain quantities or phenomena inadequately described and only qualitatively tells us what to expect. Measurement and other procedures determine the facts more precisely.
2. Known observations don’t quite tally with theory. What’s wrong? Tidy up the theory or show that the experimental data were defective.
3. The theory may have a solid mathematical formulation, but one is not yet able to comprehend its consequences. Kuhn gives the apt name of articulation to the process of bringing out what is implicit in the theory, often by mathematical analysis.

Since the 1980s there has been a substantial shift in emphasis, with historians, sociologists, and philosophers attending seriously to experimental science.

Immense experimental or instrumental novelty is simply missed in Kuhn’s theoretical stance, so normal science may have a great deal of novelty, just not theoretical. And for the general public, which wants technologies and cures, the novelties for which science is admired are usually not theoretical at all. That is why Kuhn’s remark sounds somehow wrongheaded.

In Kuhn’s idea of normal science, notice that the high-energy physics most widely reported by science journalists is the search for the Higgs particle. This involves an incredible treasury of both money and talent, all of which is dedicated to confirming what present physics teaches—that there is an as yet undetected particle that plays an essential role in the very existence of matter.

In one sense, nothing new in the way of theory or even phenomena is anticipated. That’s what Kuhn was right about. Normal science does not aim at novelty. But novelty can emerge from confirmation of theories already held. 

it is hoped that when the right conditions for eliciting the particle are finally established, an entire new generation of high-energy physics will begin.

### Paradigm (§V)

Kuhn single-handedly changed the currency of the word paradigm so that a new reader attaches very different connotations to the word than were available to the author in 1962.

Nowadays paradigm, along with its companion paradigm shift, is embarrassingly everywhere.

Today, it is pretty hard to escape the damn word, which is why Kuhn wrote even in 1970 that he had lost control of it.

The Greek word paradeigma played an important part in Aristotle’s theory of argument, especially in the book called Rhetoric. That book is about practical argument between two parties, an orator and an audience, who share a great many beliefs that hardly need stating. In English translations the ancestor of our word paradigm is usually rendered as example, but Aristotle meant something more like exemplar, a very best and most instructive example. He thought that there are two basic types of arguments. One kind of argument is essentially deductive, but with many unstated premises. The other is essentially analogical.

In general: Something is in dispute. One states a compelling example about which almost everyone in the audience will agree—a paradigm. The implication is that what is in dispute is “just like that.”

In Latin translations of Aristotle, paradeigma became exemplum, which pursued its own career in mediaeval and renaissance theories of argument. The word paradigm was, however, conserved in modern European languages but largely divorced from rhetoric.

When schoolchildren had to learn Latin, they were told to conjugate to love—“I love,” “thou lovest,” “he/she/it loves”—as amo, amas, amat, and so on. That was the paradigm, the model to imitate with similar verbs. The primary use of the word paradigm was in connection with grammar, but it was always available as a metaphor.

You cannot claim we lack free will (for example), because we had to learn the use of the expression “free will” from examples, and they are the paradigms.

Moreover, the achievements are not just anything notable. They are

1.“sufficiently unprecedented to attract an enduring group of adherents” away from what has been going on. And
2.they are open-ended, with plenty of problems for the “redefined group of practitioners to resolve.”

Kuhn concluded: “Achievements that share these two characteristics I shall henceforth refer to as ‘paradigms’ ”

Paradigms are integral to normal science, and a normal science, practiced by a scientific community, continues as long as there is plenty to do, open problems which yield to research using methods (laws, instruments, etc.) acknowledged by the tradition.

All is well until the methods legitimated by the paradigm cannot cope with a cluster of anomalies; crisis results and persists until a new achievement redirects research and serves as a new paradigm. That is a paradigm shift.

Natural analogies and resemblances can be found within almost any group of items; a paradigm is not only an achievement but also a particular way of modeling future practice upon it.

One has to acquire an “ability to see resemblances between apparently disparate problems.”

Kuhn admitted in “Second Thoughts on Paradigms” that he was far too generous in his use of the word paradigm. So he distinguished two families of uses of the idea, one global and one local. The local uses are various types of exemplar. The global use focuses first on the idea of a scientific community.

There is no question about what a scientific community “is.” The question is what binds its members together as working in the same discipline.

What keeps the group together as a group? What will cause a group to divide into sects, or simply to fall apart? 

“What shared elements account for the relatively unproblematic character of professional communication and for the relative unanimity of professional judgment? To this question The Structure of Scientific Revolutions licenses the answer ‘a paradigm’ or ‘a set of paradigms.’”

In Structure, a normal science begins with an achievement that serves as paradigm. Before then we have a pre-paradigm period of speculation, for example early discussions of phenomena of heat, of magnetism, of electricity, before “the second scientific revolution” brought with it a wave of paradigms for these fields.

“Whatever paradigms may be, they are possessed by any scientific community, including the schools of the so-called preparadigm period.”

Second thoughts are not necessarily better than first thoughts.

### Anomaly (§VI)

Normal science does not aim at novelty but at clearing up the status quo. It tends to discover what it expects to discover. 

Discovery comes not when something goes right but when something is awry, a novelty that runs counter to what was expected. In short, what appears to be an anomaly.

The a in anomaly is the a that means ‘not’, as in ‘amoral’ or ‘atheist’. The nom is from the Greek word for ‘law’. Anomalies are contrary to lawlike regularities, more generally, contrary to expectations.

We have a tendency to see what we expect, even when it is not there.

Not every anomaly is taken to matter... ...Once understood, the motion was powerful evidence for the molecular theory, but previously it was a mere curiosity. The same is true of many phenomena that run counter to theory but are just put aside. There are always discrepancies between theory and data, many of them large. The recognition of something as a significant anomaly that must be explained—more than a discrepancy that will sort itself out in time—is itself a complex historical event, not a simple refutation.

### Crisis (§§VII–VIII)

“The decision to reject one paradigm is always simultaneously the decision to accept another, and the judgment leading to that decision involves the comparison of both paradigms with nature and with each other”

“To reject one paradigm without simultaneously substituting another is to reject science itself.”

A crisis involves a period of extraordinary, rather than normal, research, with a “proliferation of competing articulations, the willingness to try anything, the expression of explicit discontent, the recourse to philosophy and to debate over fundamentals”

Without this pattern of anomaly, crisis, and new paradigm, we would be stuck in the mud. We would simply not get new theories.

### Changes of World View (§X)

Most people have no problem with the idea that the world views of a community or of an individual can change over time... ...Of course, if there has been a paradigm shift, a revolution in ideas, knowledge, and research projects, one’s vision of the kind of world in which we live will change. 

The cautious will gladly say that one’s view of the world changes, but the world stays the same.

After a revolution, scientists, in the field that has been changed, work in a different world. 

There is a lot of room for confusion if one starts talking about different worlds. All sorts of things may be meant.

But it is not a “hypothesis” that there is just one world in which I am gardening, the same one in which Lavoisier went to the guillotine. (But what a different world that was!) I hope you see how confusing things can get.

“say what you want so long as you know what you mean”

Kuhn wanted to say more than that. But in print he stuck to the try-out mode, of what one “may want to say.” He never asserted in cold print that after Lavoisier (1743–94) chemists lived in a different world, and a different one again after Dalton (1766–1844).

### Incommensurability

Here is a simplistic parody of one line of thinking that is heavily linguistic, that is, focused on meanings. I am not saying anyone said anything quite this simpleminded, but it does capture the idea. It was thought that the names of things you can observe can be learned by pointing. But what about theoretical entities, such as electrons, at which one cannot point? They get their meaning, it was taught, only from the context of the theory in which they occur. Hence a change in theory must entail a change in meaning. Hence a statement about electrons in the context of one theory means something different from the same string of words in the context of another theory. If one theory says the sentence is true and another says it is false, there is no contradiction, for the sentence expresses different statements in the two theories, and they cannot be compared.

Theories should be accurate in their predictions, consistent, broad in scope, present phenomena in an orderly and coherent way, and be fruitful in suggesting new phenomena or relationships between phenomena. 

Kuhn was calling in question the very idea of theory choice. It is usually close to nonsense to speak of an investigator choosing a theory within which to work.

Large-scale investigations, in for example high-energy physics, usually require collaboration between many specialties which in detail are opaque to each other. How is this possible? They evolve a “trading-zone” analogous to the creoles that emerge when two very different linguistic groups engage in trade.

The idea of incommensurability is helpful in an unexpected way. 

Specialization is a fact of human civilization, and it is a fact of the sciences.

Kuhn thought this was predictable. Science, he said, is Darwinian, and revolutions are often like speciation events, in which one species splits into two, or in which one species continues but with a variant on the side following its own trajectory. 
 
In crisis more than one paradigm may emerge, each able to incorporate a different group of anomalies and branch out in new research directions. As these new subdisciplines develop, each with its own achievements on which research is modeled, it becomes increasingly difficult for practitioners of one to understand what the other is doing. This is not a deep metaphysical point; it is a familiar fact of life to any working scientist.

Kuhn devoted the end of his career to trying to explain this and other sorts of incommensurability in terms of a new theory of scientific language. He was a physicist ever, and what he proposed has the same property of trying to reduce everything to a simple rather abstract structure.

The work of Kuhn’s final years can be said to be engaged in the logical syntax of the language of science.

### Progress through Revolutions (§13)

Scientific knowledge is cumulative, building upon previous benchmarks to scale new peaks.

A revolution destroys the continuity. Many things that an older science did well may be forgotten as a new set of problems is posed by a new paradigm.

We had thought of a science as progressing towards the truth in its domain.

A revolution changes the domain, changes even (according to Kuhn) the very language in which we speak about some aspect of nature.

Revolutions progress away from previous conceptions of the world that have run into cataclysmic difficulties.

The thought that there is one and only one complete true account of everything is deep in the Western tradition. It descends from what Comte, the founder of positivism, called the theological stage of human inquiry.

This image gets transposed to fundamental physics, many of whose practitioners, who might proudly proclaim themselves to be atheists, take for granted that there just is, waiting to be discovered, one full and complete account of nature.

Kuhn rejected that picture. “Does it really help,” he asked on page 170, “to imagine that there is some one full, objective, true account of nature and that the proper measure of scientific achievement is the extent to which it brings us closer to that ultimate goal?” Many scientists would say that yes, it does; it grounds their image of what they do, and why it is worthwhile. Kuhn was too brief with his rhetorical question. It is a topic for the reader to pursue. 

A majority of hard-headed analytic philosophers probably do the same, if only on the obvious ground of circularity—there is no way to specify the fact to which an arbitrary statement corresponds except by stating the statement.

In the wave of skepticism that swept American scholarship at the end of the twentieth century, many influential intellectuals took Kuhn as an ally in their denials of truth as a virtue. I mean the thinkers of the sort that cannot write down or utter the word true except by literally or figuratively putting quotation marks around it—to indicate how they shudder at the very thought of so harmful a notion.

One of Kuhn’s marvelous legacies is science studies as we know it today.

## Preface

Whatever their pedagogic utility and their abstract plausibility, those notions did not at all fit the enterprise that historical study displayed. Yet they were and are fundamental to many discussions of science, and their failures of verisimilitude therefore seemed thoroughly worth pursuing. The result was a drastic shift in my career plans, a shift from physics to history of science.

Eight public lectures, delivered during March, 1951, on “The Quest for Physical Theory.” In the next year I began to teach history of science proper, and for almost a decade the problems of instructing in a field I had never systematically studied left little time for explicit articulation of the ideas that had first brought me to it.

Spend the year 1958–59 at the Center for Advanced Studies in the Behavioral Sciences. Once again I was able to give undivided attention to the problems discussed below. Even more important, spending the year in a community composed predominantly of social scientists confronted me with unanticipated problems about the differences between such communities and those of the natural scientists among whom I had been trained. Particularly, I was struck by the number and extent of the overt disagreements between social scientists about the nature of legitimate scientific problems and methods.

Attempting to discover the source of that difference led me to recognize the role in scientific research of what I have since called “paradigms.” These  I take to be universally recognized scientific achievements that for a time provide model problems and solutions to a community of practitioners.

The view of science to be developed here suggests the potential fruitfulness of a number of new sorts of research, both historical and sociological. 

If I am right that each scientific revolution alters the historical perspective of the community that experiences it, then that change of perspective should affect the structure of postrevolutionary textbooks and research publications.

The need for drastic condensation has also forced me to forego discussion of a number of major problems.

Clearly, there are such implications, and I have tried both to point out and to document the main ones. But in doing so I have usually refrained from detailed discussion of the various positions taken by contemporary philosophers on the corresponding issues. Where I have indicated skepticism, it has more often been directed to a philosophical attitude than to any one of its fully articulated expressions.

## I Introduction: A Role for History

History, if viewed as a repository for more than anecdote or chronology, could produce a decisive transformation in the image of science by which we are now possessed. That image has previously been drawn, even by scientists themselves, mainly from the study of finished scientific achievements as these are recorded in the classics and, more recently, in the textbooks from which each new scientific generation learns to practice its trade.

If science is the constellation of facts, theories, and methods collected in current texts, then scientists are the men who, successfully or not, have striven to contribute one or another element to that particular constellation. Scientific development becomes the piecemeal process by which these items have been added, singly and in combination, to the ever growing stockpile that constitutes scientific technique and knowledge. And history of science becomes the discipline that chronicles both these successive increments and the obstacles that have inhibited their accumulation. 

In recent years, however, a few historians of science have been finding it more and more difficult to fulfil the functions that the concept of development-by-accumulation assigns to them. As chroniclers of an incremental process, they discover that additional research makes it harder, not easier, to answer questions like: When was oxygen discovered? Who first conceived of energy conservation? Increasingly, a few of them suspect that these are simply the wrong sorts of questions to ask. Perhaps science does not develop by the accumulation of individual discoveries and inventions. Simultaneously, these same historians confront growing difficulties in distinguishing the “scientific” component of past observation and belief from what their predecessors had readily labeled “error” and “superstition.” The more carefully they study, say, Aristotelian dynamics, phlogistic chemistry, or caloric thermodynamics, the more certain they feel that those once current views of nature were, as a whole, neither less scientific nor more the product of human idiosyncrasy than those current today.

Out-of-date theories are not in principle unscientific because they have been discarded.

The same historical research that displays the difficulties in isolating individual inventions and discoveries gives ground for profound doubts about the cumulative process through which these individual contributions to science were thought to have been compounded.

Gradually, and often without entirely realizing they are doing so, historians of science have begun to ask new sorts of questions and to trace different, and often less than cumulative, developmental lines for the sciences. Rather than seeking the permanent contributions of an older science to our present vantage, they attempt to display the historical integrity of that science in its own time. 

They ask, for example, not about the relation of Galileo’s views to those of modern science, but rather about the relationship between his views and those of his group, i.e., his teachers, contemporaries, and immediate successors in the sciences.

Seen through the works that result, works perhaps best exemplified in the writings of Alexandre Koyré, science does not seem altogether the same enterprise as the one discussed by writers in the older historiographic tradition. By implication, at least, these historical studies suggest the possibility of a new image of science. This essay aims to delineate that image by making explicit some of the new historiography’s implications.

Instructed to examine electrical or chemical phenomena, the man who is ignorant of these fields but who knows what it is to be scientific may legitimately reach any one of a number of incompatible conclusions... ...What beliefs about the stars, for example, does he bring to the study of chemistry or electricity? Which of the many conceivable experiments relevant to the new field does he elect to perform first? And what aspects of the complex phenomenon that then results strike him as particularly relevant to an elucidation of the nature of chemical change or of electrical affinity? For the individual, at least, and sometimes for the scientific community as well, answers to questions like these are often essential determinants of scientific development.

Observation and experience can and must drastically restrict the range of admissible scientific belief, else there would be no science.
'
Effective research scarcely begins before a scientific community thinks it has acquired firm answers to questions like the following: What are the fundamental entities of which the universe is composed? How do these interact with each other and with the senses? What questions may legitimately be asked about such entities and what techniques employed in seeking solutions? At least in the mature sciences, answers (or full substitutes for answers) to questions like these are firmly embedded in the educational initiation that prepares and licenses the student for professional practice.

Normal science, the activity in which most scientists inevitably spend almost all their time, is predicated on the assumption that the scientific community knows what the world is like. Much of the success of the enterprise derives from the community’s willingness to defend that assumption, if necessary at considerable cost. Normal science, for example, often suppresses fundamental novelties because they are necessarily subversive of its basic commitments.

When, that is, the profession can no longer evade anomalies that subvert the existing tradition of scientific practice—then begin the extraordinary investigations that lead the profession at last to a new set of commitments, a new basis for the practice of science. The extraordinary episodes in which that shift of professional commitments occurs are the ones known in this essay as scientific revolutions. They are the tradition-shattering complements to the tradition-bound activity of normal science.
