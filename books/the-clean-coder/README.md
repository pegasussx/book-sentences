# Table of contents

## Foreword

It was the sort of environment in which some people complain, and others point out that “pressure makes diamonds.”

## Preface

As an engineer, you have a depth of knowledge about your systems and projects that no managers can possibly have. With that knowledge comes the responsibility to _act_.

## Acknowledgments

No one in your life will teach you more than your children will.

The crab nebula is the remnant of a super-nova... ...At the very center of the target is a bright blue dot. That’s where the _pulsar_ is... ...The pulsar is spinning about 30 times per second; and it flashes as it spins... ...Those pulses of light are the reason we call it a pulsar, which is short for Pulsating Star.

## Pre-Requisite Introduction

Never quit without having a new job, and you always quit calmly, coolly, and alone.
