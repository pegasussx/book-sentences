# You Don't Know JS Yet: Get Started

## Foreword

This is what this book series is great for. It’s not just for someone picking up the language for the first time (though it’s for them, too); it’s for all software craftspeople who want to master their tools, who want to understand the ins and outs of their trade, and who want to select the proper methods for solving problems.

## Preface

### The Parts

These books approach JavaScript intentionally opposite of how The Good Parts treats the language. No, that doesn’t mean we’re looking at the bad parts, but rather, exploring all the parts.

You may have been told, or felt yourself, that JS is a deeply flawed language that was poorly designed and inconsistently implemented. Many have asserted that it’s the worst most popular language in the world; that nobody writes JS because they want to, only because they have to given its place at the center of the web. That’s a ridiculous, unhealthy, and wholly condescending claim. Millions of developers write JavaScript every day, and many of them appreciate and respect the language. Like any great language, it has its brilliant parts as well as its scars. Even the creator of JavaScript himself, Brendan Eich, laments some of those parts as mistakes. But he’s wrong: they weren’t mistakes at all. JS is what it is today—the world’s most ubiquitous and thus most influential programming language—precisely because of all those parts.

Don’t buy the lie that you should only learn and use a small collection of good parts while avoiding all the bad stuff. Don’t buy the “X is the new Y” snake oil, that some new feature of the language instantly relegates all usage of a previous feature as obsolete and ignorant.

Every part of JS is useful. Some parts are more useful than others. Some parts require you to be more careful and intentional.

You should go about learning all parts of JavaScript, and where appropriate, use them!

### The Title?

Most JS developers don’t take the time to really understand how the code that they write works. They know that it works—that it produces a desired outcome. But they either don’t understand exactly how, or worse, they have an inaccurate mental model for the how that falters on closer scrutiny.

Why is one way better or more appropriate than the other half-dozen ways you could have accomplished it? Why do all the “popular kids” say to do X with your code, but it turns out that Y might be a better choice?

You don’t finish knowing everything about JS, you just keep learning more and more as you spend more time with the language. And the deeper you go, the more you revisit what you knew before, and you re-learn it from that more experienced perspective.

You can always know JS better than you currently do.

### The Mission

Far too often, what counts is generally just the result of the program, not how the program is written or how/why it works.

You will always be more effective in your development work if you more completely understand how your code works than you are solely just getting it to produce a desired outcome.

Good enough to work is not, and should not be, good enough.

All developers regularly struggle with some piece of code not working correctly, and they can’t figure out why. But far too often, JS developers will blame this on the language rather than admitting it’s their own understanding that is falling short.

### The Path

My suggestion is you take your time going through YDKJSY. Take one chapter, read it completely through start to finish, and then go back and re-read it section by section. Stop in between each section, and practice the code or ideas from that section. For larger concepts, it probably is a good idea to expect to spend several days digesting, re-reading, practicing, then digesting some more.

The deeper you understand JS, the more questions you will ask and the more you will have to explore! That’s what I find so exciting!

## Chapter 1: What Is JavaScript?

You don’t know JS, yet. Neither do I, not fully anyway. None of us do. But we can all start getting to know JS better.

We need to start by covering a variety of important background housekeeping details, clearing up some myths and misconceptions about what the language really is (and isn’t!).

### About This Book

Knowing JS is not a destination, it’s a direction

Three main pillars around which the JS language is organized: scope/closures, prototypes/objects, and types/coercion. JS is a broad and sophisticated language, with many features and capabilities. But all of JS is founded on these three foundational pillars.

A good start always depends on a solid first step.

### What’s With That Name?

JavaScript is an artifact of marketing shenanigans. When Brendan Eich first conceived of the language, he code-named it Mocha. Internally at Netscape, the brand LiveScript was used. But when it came time to publicly name the language, “JavaScript” won the vote.

There are some superficial resemblances between JavaScript’s code and Java code... ...both languages targeting developers with assumed syntax expectations from C (and to an extent, C++). For example, we use the { to begin a block of code and the } to end that block of code, just like C/C++ and Java. We also use the ; to punctuate the end of a statement.

The official name of the language specified by TC39 and formalized by the ECMA standards body is ECMAScript. 

“Java is to JavaScript as ham is to hamster.” –Jeremy Keith, 2009

### Language Specification

TC39, the technical steering committee that manages JS. Their primary task is managing the official specification for the language.

ES2019 happens to be the 10th major numbered specification/revision since JS’s inception in 1995, so in the specification’s official URL as hosted by ECMA, you’ll find “10.0”: https://www.ecma-international.org/ecma-262/10.0/

All TC39 proposals progress through a five-stage process—of course, since we’re programmers, it’s 0-based!—Stage 0 through Stage 4. You can read more about the Stage process here: https://tc39.es/process-document/

Lots of ideas that non-TC39 members “propose,” through informal means such as social media or blog posts, are really “pre-stage 0.” You have to get a TC39 member to champion a proposal for it to be considered “Stage 0” officially.

All proposals are managed in the open, on TC39’s Github repository: https://github.com/tc39/proposals

There’s just one JS, the official standard as maintained by TC39 and ECMA.
