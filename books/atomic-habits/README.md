a·tom·ic 

1. an extremely small amount of a thing; the single irreducible unit of a larger system. 
2. the source of immense energy or power. 

hab·it

1. a routine or practice performed regularly; an automatic response to a specific situation.

## Introduction: My Story 

ON THE FINAL day of my sophomore year of high school, I was hit in the face with a baseball bat... ...After yet another seizure—my third of the day—I was put into a medically induced coma and placed on a ventilator... ...My mother would tell me later, “It was one of the worst nights I’ve ever had.”

### MY RECOVERY

By the next morning my breathing had rebounded to the point where the doctors felt comfortable releasing me from the coma... ...The following months were hard. It felt like everything in my life was on pause... ...Despite my lackluster high school career, I still believed I could become a great player. And I knew that if things were going to improve, I was the one responsible for making it happen.

### HOW I LEARNED ABOUT HABITS

Good sleep habits and went to bed early each night... ...keep my room neat and tidy. These improvements were minor, but they gave me a sense of control over my life. I started to feel confident again... ...A habit is a routine or behavior that is performed regularly—and, in many cases, automatically.

I fulfilled my potential.

We all face challenges in life.

Changes that seem small and unimportant at first will compound into remarkable results if you’re willing to stick with them for years.

In the long run, the quality of our lives often depends on the quality of our habits.

With the same habits, you’ll end up with the same results. But with better habits, anything is possible.

The only way I made progress—the only choice I had—was to start small.

### HOW AND WHY I WROTE THIS BOOK

In 2014, my email list expanded to over one hundred thousand subscribers, which made it one of the fastest-growing newsletters on the internet. I had felt like an impostor when I began writing two years earlier, but now I was becoming known as an expert on habits—a new label that excited me but also felt uncomfortable.

As I put the finishing touches on this book in 2018, jamesclear.com is receiving millions of visitors per month and nearly five hundred thousand people subscribe to my weekly email newsletter—a number that is so far beyond my expectations when I began that I’m not even sure what to think of it.

### HOW THIS BOOK WILL BENEFIT YOU

Naval Ravikant has said, “To write a great book, you must first become the book.”

Small habits helped me fulfill my potential,

In the pages that follow, I will share a step-by-step plan for building better habits—not for days or weeks, but for a lifetime.

This book... ...it’s an operating manual. You’ll find wisdom and practical advice front and center as I explain the science of how to create and change your habits in a way that is easy to understand and apply.

The backbone of this book is my four-step model of habits—cue, craving, response, and reward—and the four laws of behavior change that evolve out of these steps.

Behavioral scientists like Skinner realized that if you offered the right reward or punishment, you could get people to act in a certain way. But while Skinner’s model did an excellent job of explaining how external stimuli influenced our habits, it lacked a good explanation for how our thoughts, feelings, and beliefs impact our behavior. Internal states—our moods and emotions—matter, too. In recent decades, scientists have begun to determine the connection between our thoughts, feelings, and behavior.

Human behavior is always changing: situation to situation, moment to moment, second to second. But this book is about what _doesn’t_ change. It’s about the fundamentals of human behavior.

As long as human behavior is involved, this book will be your guide.

## The Fundamentals Why Tiny Changes Make a Big Difference

## 1 The Surprising Power of Atomic Habits

Brailsford said, “The whole principle came from the idea that if you broke down everything you could think of that goes into riding a bike, and then improve it by 1 percent, you will get a significant increase when you put them all together.”

Why do small improvements accumulate into such remarkable results, and how can you replicate this approach in your own life?

### WHY SMALL HABITS MAKE A BIG DIFFERENCE

It is so easy to overestimate the importance of one defining moment and underestimate the value of making small improvements on a daily basis.

Too often, we convince ourselves that massive success requires massive action.

Improving by 1 percent isn’t particularly notable—sometimes it isn’t even _noticeable_ —but it can be far more meaningful, especially in the long run.

If you can get 1 percent better each day for one year, you’ll end up thirty-seven times better by the time you’re done. Conversely, if you get 1 percent worse each day for one year, you’ll decline nearly down to zero.

![Figure 1](./figure1.jpg)

FIGURE 1: The effects of small habits compound over time. For example, if you can get just 1 percent better each day, you’ll end up with results that are nearly 37 times better after one year.

Habits are the compound interest of self-improvement.

The effects of your habits multiply as you repeat them. They seem to make little difference on any given day and yet the impact they deliver over the months and years can be enormous.

It is only when looking back two, five, or perhaps ten years later that the value of good habits and the cost of bad ones becomes strikingly apparent.

We make a few changes, but the results never seem to come quickly and so we slide back into our previous routines.

Unfortunately, the slow pace of transformation also makes it easy to let a bad habit slide.

But when we repeat 1 percent errors, day after day, by replicating poor decisions, duplicating tiny mistakes, and rationalizing little excuses, our small choices compound into toxic results.

It’s the accumulation of many missteps—a 1 percent decline here and there—that eventually leads to a problem.

The impact created by a change in your habits is similar to the effect of shifting the route of an airplane by just a few degrees.

Imagine you are flying from Los Angeles to New York City. If a pilot leaving from LAX adjusts the heading just 3.5 degrees south, you will land in Washington, D.C., instead of New York. Such a small change is barely noticeable at takeoff—the nose of the airplane moves just a few feet—but when magnified across the entire United States, you end up hundreds of miles apart.

A slight change in your daily habits can guide your life to a very different destination.

Making a choice that is 1 percent better or 1 percent worse seems insignificant in the moment, but over the span of moments that make up a lifetime these choices determine the difference between who you are and who you could be.

Success is the product of daily habits—not once-in-a-lifetime transformations.

What matters is whether your habits are putting you on the path toward success. 

You should be far more concerned with your current trajectory than with your current results.

Your outcomes are a lagging measure of your habits.

Your net worth is a lagging measure of your financial habits. Your weight is a lagging measure of your eating habits. Your knowledge is a lagging measure of your learning habits... ...You get what you repeat.

If you want to predict where you’ll end up in life, all you have to do is follow the curve of tiny gains or tiny losses, and see how your daily choices will compound ten or twenty years down the line.

Time magnifies the margin between success and failure. It will multiply whatever you feed it. Good habits make time your ally. Bad habits make time your enemy.

Habits are a double-edged sword. 15 Bad habits can cut you down just as easily as good habits can build you up, which is why understanding the details is crucial. You need to know how habits work and how to design them to your liking, so you can avoid the dangerous half of the blade.

### YOUR HABITS CAN COMPOUND FOR YOU OR AGAINST YOU

| Positive Compounding | Negative Compounding |
| -------------------- | -------------------- |
| **Productivity compounds.**... ...The effect of automating an old task or mastering a new skill can be even greater. The more tasks you can handle without thinking, the more your brain is free to focus on other areas. | **Stress compounds.**... ...common causes of stress are manageable. But when they persist for years, little stresses compound into serious health issues.|
| **Knowledge compounds.**... ...a commitment to lifelong learning can be transformative. Furthermore, each book you read not only teaches you something new but also opens up different ways of thinking about old ideas. | **Negative thoughts compound.** The more you think of yourself as worthless, stupid, or ugly, the more you condition yourself to interpret life that way. You get trapped in a thought loop. The same is true for how you think about others. Once you fall into the habit of seeing people as angry, unjust, or selfish, you see those kind of people everywhere. |
| **Relationships compound.** People reflect your behavior back to you. The more you help others, the more others want to help you. Being a little bit nicer in each interaction can result in a network of broad and strong connections over time. | **Outrage compounds.**... ...series of microaggressions and daily aggravations slowly multiply until one event tips the scales and outrage spreads like wildfire. |

> “That’s how knowledge works. It builds up, like compound interest.”
> -Warren Buffett
 
### WHAT PROGRESS IS REALLY LIKE

Imagine that you have an ice cube sitting on the table in front of you. The room is cold and you can see your breath. It is currently twenty-five degrees. Ever so slowly, the room begins to heat up. Twenty-six degrees. Twenty-seven. Twenty-eight. The ice cube is still sitting on the table in front of you. Twenty-nine degrees. Thirty. Thirty-one. Still, nothing has happened. Then, thirty-two degrees. The ice begins to melt. A one-degree shift, seemingly no different from the temperature increases before it, has unlocked a huge change.

Breakthrough moments are often the result of many previous actions, which build up the potential required to unleash a major change.

Bamboo can barely be seen for the first five years as it builds extensive root systems underground before exploding ninety feet into the air within six weeks.

Habits often appear to make no difference until you cross a critical threshold and unlock a new level of performance.

It’s frustrating how ineffective changes can seem during the first days, weeks, and even months. It doesn’t feel like you are going anywhere... ...the most powerful outcomes are delayed.

It is so hard to build habits that last. People make a few small changes, fail to see a tangible result, and decide to stop.

in order to make a meaningful difference, habits need to persist long enough to break through this plateau—what I call the _Plateau of Latent Potential._ 

If you find yourself struggling to build a good habit or break a bad one, it is not because you have lost your ability to improve. It is often because you have not yet crossed the Plateau of Latent Potential.

When you finally break through the Plateau of Latent Potential, people... ...only sees the most dramatic event rather than all that preceded it. But you know that it’s the work you did long ago—when... ...progress—that makes the jump today possible.

Mastery requires patience.

> Jacob Riis hanging in their locker room: “When nothing seems to help, I go and look at a stonecutter hammering away at his rock, perhaps a hundred times without as much as a crack showing in it. 19 Yet at the hundred and first blow it will split in two, and I know it was not that last blow that did it—but all that had gone before.”
> -Jacob Riis
 
![Figure 2](./figure2.jpg)

FIGURE 2: We often expect progress to be linear... ...In reality, the results of our efforts are often delayed... ...This can result in a “valley of disappointment” where people feel discouraged after putting in weeks or months of hard work without experiencing any results. However, this work was not wasted... ...It is not until much later that the full value of previous efforts is revealed.

All big things come from small beginnings.

The seed of every habit is a single, tiny decision. But as that decision is repeated, a habit sprouts and grows stronger.

The task of breaking a bad habit is like uprooting a powerful oak within us. And the task of building a good habit is like cultivating a delicate flower one day at a time.

### FORGET ABOUT GOALS, FOCUS ON SYSTEMS INSTEAD

Prevailing wisdom claims that the best way to achieve what we want in life... ...is to set specific, actionable goals. For many years, this was how I approached my habits, too... ...Eventually, I began to realize that my results had very little to do with the goals I set and nearly everything to do with the systems I followed.

What’s the difference between systems and goals?... ...Goals are about the results you want to achieve. Systems are about the processes that lead to those results.

Now for the interesting question: If you completely ignored your goals and focused only on your system, would you still succeed?... ...I think you would.

> “The score takes care of itself.”
> Bill Walsh
 
If you want better results, then forget about setting goals. Focus on your system instead.

Goals are good for setting a direction, but systems are best for making progress.

A handful of problems arise when you spend too much time thinking about your goals and not enough time designing your systems.

**Problem #1: Winners and losers have the same goals.**

If successful and unsuccessful people share the same goals, then the goal cannot be what differentiates the winners from the losers.

It wasn’t the _goal_... ...The goal had always been there. It was only when they implemented a _system_ of continuous small improvements that they achieved a different outcome.

**Problem #2: Achieving a goal is only a momentary change.**

Imagine you have a messy room and you set a goal to clean it. If you summon the energy to tidy up, then you will have a clean room—for now. But if you maintain the same sloppy, pack-rat habits that led to a messy room in the first place, soon you’ll be looking at a new pile of clutter and hoping for another burst of motivation.

You’re left chasing the same outcome because you never changed the system behind it.

You treated a symptom without addressing the cause.

Achieving a goal only changes your life _for the moment._

We think we need to change our results, but the results are not the problem. What we really need to change are the systems that cause those results.

When you solve problems at the results level, you only solve them temporarily. In order to improve for good, you need to solve problems at the systems level.

Fix the inputs and the outputs will fix themselves.

**Problem #3: Goals restrict your happiness.**

The implicit assumption behind any goal is this: “Once I reach my goal, then I’ll be happy.” The problem with a goals-first mentality is that you’re continually putting happiness off until the next milestone.

Furthermore, goals create an “either-or” conflict: either you achieve your goal and are successful or you fail and you are a disappointment. 

You mentally box yourself into a narrow version of happiness. This is misguided. 

It is unlikely that your actual path through life will match the exact journey you had in mind when you set out.

It makes no sense to restrict your satisfaction to one scenario when there are many paths to success.

When you fall in love with the process rather than the product, you don’t have to wait to give yourself permission to be happy. You can be satisfied anytime your system is running.

A system can be successful in many different forms, not just the one you first envision.

**Problem #4: Goals are at odds with long-term progress.**

When all of your hard work is focused on a particular goal, what is left to push you forward after you achieve it? This is why many people find themselves reverting to their old habits after accomplishing a goal. 

The purpose of setting goals is to win the game. The purpose of building systems is to continue playing the game. 

True long-term thinking is goal-less thinking.

It is about the cycle of endless refinement and continuous improvement. 

Ultimately, it is your commitment to the _process_ that will determine your _progress._

### A SYSTEM OF ATOMIC HABITS

If you’re having trouble changing your habits, the problem isn’t you. The problem is your system. 

Bad habits repeat themselves again and again not because you don’t want to change, but because you have the wrong system for change. 

You do not rise to the level of your goals. You fall to the level of your systems.

Atomic habits... ...are little habits that are part of a larger system. Just as atoms are the building blocks of molecules, atomic habits are the building blocks of remarkable results.

At first, these tiny routines seem insignificant, but soon they build on each other and fuel bigger wins that multiply to a degree that far outweighs the cost of their initial investment.

_atomic habits_ —a regular practice or routine that is not only small and easy to do, but also the source of incredible power; a component of the system of compound growth.

Chapter Summary:
- Habits are the compound interest of self-improvement. Getting 1 percent better every day counts for a lot in the long-run. 
- Habits are a double-edged sword. They can work for you or against you, which is why understanding the details is essential. 
- Small changes often appear to make no difference until you cross a critical threshold. The most powerful outcomes of any compounding process are delayed. You need to be patient.

## 2 How Your Habits Shape Your Identity (and Vice Versa)

WHY IS IT so easy to repeat bad habits and so hard to form good ones?

It often feels difficult to keep good habits going for more than a few days, even with sincere effort and the occasional burst of motivation.

once your habits are established, they seem to stick around forever—especially the unwanted ones.

Changing our habits is challenging for two reasons: (1) we try to change the wrong thing and (2) we try to change our habits in the wrong way.

Our first mistake is that we try to change the wrong thing... ...consider that there are three levels at which change can occur. You can imagine them like the layers of an onion.
 
![Figure 3](./figure3.jpg)

FIGURE 3: There are three layers of behavior change: a change in your outcomes, a change in your processes, or a change in your identity.

**The first layer is changing your outcomes.** This level is concerned with changing your results:... ...Most of the goals you set are associated with this level of change... ...**The second layer is changing your process.** This level is concerned with changing your habits and systems:... ...Most of the habits you build are associated with this level. **The third and deepest layer is changing your identity.** This level is concerned with changing your beliefs:... ...Most of the beliefs, assumptions, and biases you hold are associated with this level.

Outcomes are about what you get. Processes are about what you do. Identity is about what you believe.

When it comes to building habits that last... ...the problem is not that one level is “better” or “worse” than another. All levels of change are useful in their own way. The problem is the _direction_ of change.

Many people begin the process of changing their habits by focusing on _what_ they want to achieve. This leads us to outcome-based habits. The alternative is to build identity-based habits. With this approach, we start by focusing on _who_ we wish to become.

![Figure 4](./figure4.jpg)

FIGURE 4: With outcome-based habits, the focus is on what you want to achieve. With identity-based habits, the focus is on who you wish to become.

Imagine two people resisting a cigarette. When offered a smoke, the first person says, “No thanks. I’m trying to quit.” It sounds like a reasonable response, but this person still believes they are a smoker who is trying to be something else. They are hoping their behavior will change while carrying around the same beliefs. The second person declines by saying, “No thanks. I’m not a smoker.” It’s a small difference, but this statement signals a shift in identity. Smoking was part of their former life, not their current one. They no longer identify as someone who smokes.

Most people don’t even consider identity change when they set out to improve... ...They set goals and determine the actions they should take to achieve those goals without considering the beliefs that drive their actions. They never shift the way they look at themselves, and they don’t realize that their old identity can sabotage their new plans for change.

Behind every system of actions are a system of beliefs.

There are a set of beliefs and assumptions that shape the system, an identity behind the habits. 

Behavior that is incongruent with the self will not last.

You may want better health, but if you continue to prioritize comfort over accomplishment, you’ll be drawn to relaxing rather than training. 

It’s hard to change your habits if you never change the underlying beliefs that led to your past behavior. You have a new goal and a new plan, but you haven’t changed _who_ you are.

The ultimate form of intrinsic motivation is when a habit becomes part of your identity. It’s one thing to say I’m the type of person who _wants_ this. It’s something very different to say I’m the type of person who is this. 

The more pride you have in a particular aspect of your identity, the more motivated you will be to maintain the habits associated with it.

True behavior change is identity change. 

You might start a habit because of motivation, but the only reason you’ll stick with one is that it becomes part of your identity. 

Anyone can convince themselves to visit the gym or eat healthy once or twice, but if you don’t shift the belief behind the behavior, then it is hard to stick with long-term changes. 

Improvements are only temporary until they become part of who you are.

The goal is not to read a book, the goal is to _become_ a reader.

What you do is an indication of the type of person you believe that you are.

Once a person believes in a particular aspect of their identity, they are more likely to act in alignment with that belief.

Doing the right thing is easy. After all, when your behavior and your identity are fully aligned, you are no longer pursuing behavior change. You are simply acting like the type of person you already believe yourself to be.

When working against you, though, identity change can be a curse. Once you have adopted an identity, it can be easy to let your allegiance to it impact your ability to change.

Many people walk through life in a cognitive slumber, blindly following the norms attached to their identity. “I’m terrible with directions.” “I’m not a morning person.” ...and a thousand other variations.

The more deeply a thought or action is tied to your identity, the more difficult it is to change it.

It can feel comfortable to believe what your culture believes (group identity) or to do what upholds your self-image (personal identity), even if it’s wrong.

The biggest barrier to positive change at any level—individual.

Good habits can make rational sense, but if they conflict with your identity, you will fail to put them into action.

On any given day, you may struggle with your habits... ...Over the long run, however, the real reason you fail to stick with habits is that your self-image gets in the way.

Progress requires unlearning. 

Becoming the best version of yourself requires you to continuously edit your beliefs, and to upgrade and expand your identity.

If your beliefs and worldview play such an important role in your behavior, where do they come from in the first place? How, exactly, is your identity formed? And how can you emphasize new aspects of your identity that serve you and gradually erase the pieces that hinder you?

### THE TWO-STEP PROCESS TO CHANGING YOUR IDENTITY

Your identity emerges out of your habits.

You are not born with preset beliefs. Every belief, including those about yourself, is learned and conditioned through experience.

Your habits are how you embody your identity. When you make your bed each day, you embody the identity of an organized person.

The more you repeat a behavior, the more you reinforce the identity associated with that behavior.

The word _identity_ was originally derived from the Latin words _essentitas,_ which means _being,_ and _identidem,_ which means _repeatedly._ Your identity is literally your “repeated beingness.”

If you go to the gym even when it’s snowing, you have evidence that you are committed to fitness. The more evidence you have for a belief, the more strongly you will believe it.

I published a new article every Monday and Thursday for the first few years. As the evidence grew, so did my identity as a writer. I didn’t start out as a writer. I _became_ one through my habits.

As you repeat these actions, however, the evidence accumulates and your self-image begins to change.

Your habits contribute most of the evidence that shapes your identity. In this way, the process of building habits is actually the process of becoming yourself.

This is a gradual evolution... ...We change bit by bit, day by day, habit by habit. We are continually undergoing microevolutions of the self... ...If you finish a book, then perhaps you are the type of person who likes reading... ...Every action you take is a vote for the type of person you wish to become.

Meaningful change does not require radical change. Small habits can make a meaningful difference by providing evidence of a new identity. And if a change is meaningful, it actually is big. That’s the paradox of making small improvements.

Habits are the path to changing your identity. The most practical way to change _who_ you are is to change _what_ you do.

Each habit not only gets results but also teaches you something far more important: to trust yourself. You start to believe you can actually accomplish these things.

When... ...the evidence begins to change, the story you tell yourself begins to change as well.

Every time you choose to perform a bad habit, it’s a vote for that identity. The good news is that you don’t need to be perfect. In any election, there are going to be votes for both sides. You don’t need a unanimous vote to win an election; you just need a majority. It doesn’t matter if you cast a few votes for a bad behavior or an unproductive habit. Your goal is simply to win the majority of the time.

New identities require new evidence. If you keep casting the same votes you’ve always cast, you’re going to get the same results you’ve always had.

If nothing changes, nothing is going to change.

It is a simple two-step process: 1. Decide the type of person you want to be. 2. Prove it to yourself with small wins.

First, decide who you want to be... ...at any level—as an individual, as a team, as a community, as a nation. What do you want to stand for? What are your principles and values? Who do you wish to become? These are big questions, and many people aren’t sure where to begin—but they do know what kind of results they want... ...That’s fine. Start there and work backward from the results you want to the type of person who could get those results. Ask yourself, “Who is the type of person that could get the outcome I want?”... ...Who is the type of person that could learn a new language?

For example, “Who is the type of person who could write a book?” It’s probably someone who is consistent and reliable. Now your focus shifts from writing a book (outcome-based) to being the type of person who is consistent and reliable (identity-based).

Beliefs like: 
- “I’m the kind of teacher who stands up for her students.” 
- “I’m the kind of doctor who gives each patient the time and empathy they need.” 
- “I’m the kind of manager who advocates for her employees.”

Feedback loops. Your habits shape your identity, and your identity shapes your habits. It’s a two-way street. The formation of all habits is a feedback loop.

It’s important to let your values, principles, and identity drive the loop rather than your results. The focus should always be on becoming that type of person, not getting a particular outcome.

### THE REAL REASON HABITS MATTER

Identity change is the North Star of habit change.

“Are you becoming the type of person you want to become?” The first step is not _what_ or _how,_ but _who._ You need to know who you want to be. Otherwise, your quest for change is like a boat without a rudder.

You have the power to change your beliefs about yourself. Your identity is not set in stone. You have a choice in every moment. 

You can choose the identity you want to reinforce today with the habits you choose today.

It’s not about achieving external measures of success like earning more money, losing weight, or reducing stress. Habits... ...are not about _having_ something. They are about _becoming_ someone.

Your habits matter because they help you become the type of person you wish to be. They are the channel through which you develop your deepest beliefs about yourself. Quite literally, you become your habits.

Chapter Summary:
- There are three levels of change: outcome change, process change, and identity change. 
- The most effective way to change your habits is to focus not on what you want to achieve, but on who you wish to become. 
- Your identity emerges out of your habits. Every action is a vote for the type of person you wish to become. 
- Becoming the best version of yourself requires you to continuously edit your beliefs, and to upgrade and expand your identity. 
- The real reason habits matter is not because they can get you better results (although they can do that), but because they can change your beliefs about yourself.

## 3 How to Build Better Habits in 4 Simple Steps

> “behaviors followed by satisfying consequences tend to be repeated and those that produce unpleasant consequences are less likely to be repeated.”
> -Thorndike

### WHY YOUR BRAIN BUILDS HABITS

A habit is a behavior that has been repeated enough times to become automatic. 

The process of habit formation begins with trial and error.

Whenever you encounter a new situation in life, your brain has to make a decision. _How do I respond to this?_ The first time you come across a problem, you’re not sure how to solve it... ...you’re just trying things out to see what works.

After you stumble upon an unexpected reward, you alter your strategy for next time. Your brain immediately begins to catalog the events that preceded the reward.

The feedback loop behind all human behavior: try, fail, learn, try differently. With practice, the useless movements fade away and the useful actions get reinforced. That’s a habit forming.

Whenever you face a problem repeatedly, your brain begins to automate the process of solving it.

> “Habits are, simply, reliable solutions to recurring problems in our environment.”
> -Jason Hreha
 
As habits are created, the level of activity in the brain _decreases._ You learn to lock in on the cues that predict success and tune out everything else. When a similar situation arises in the future, you know exactly what to look for.

Your brain skips the process of trial and error and creates a mental rule: if this, then that.

A habit is just a memory of the steps you previously followed to solve a problem in the past.

The primary reason the brain remembers the past is to better predict what will work in the future.

Habit formation is incredibly useful because the conscious mind is the bottleneck of the brain. It can only pay attention to one problem at a time.

Whenever possible, the conscious mind likes to pawn off tasks to the nonconscious mind to do automatically... ...Habits reduce cognitive load and free up mental capacity, so you can allocate your attention to other tasks.

Habits do not restrict freedom. They create it.

If you’re always being forced to make decisions about simple tasks... ...then you have less time for freedom. It’s only by making the fundamentals of life easier that you can create the mental space needed for free thinking and creativity.

When you have your habits dialed in and the basics of life are handled and done, your mind is free to focus on new challenges and master the next set of problems.

Building habits in the present allows you to do more of what you want in the future.

### THE SCIENCE OF HOW HABITS WORK

The process of building a habit can be divided into four simple steps: cue, craving, response, and reward.

![Figure 5](./figure5.jpg)

FIGURE 5: All habits proceed through four stages in the same order: cue, craving, response, and reward.

The cue triggers your brain to initiate a behavior. It is a bit of information that predicts a reward.

Your mind is continuously analyzing your internal and external environment for hints of where rewards are located. Because the cue is the first indication that we’re close to a reward, it naturally leads to a craving.

Cravings are the second step, and they are the motivational force behind every habit. Without some level of motivation or desire—without craving a change—we have no reason to act. 

What you crave is not the habit itself but the change in state it delivers.

You are not motivated by brushing your teeth but rather by the feeling of a clean mouth.

Cravings differ from person to person. In theory, any piece of information could trigger a craving, but in practice, people are not motivated by the same cues.

Cues are meaningless until they are interpreted. The thoughts, feelings, and emotions of the observer are what transform a cue into a craving. 

The third step is the response... ...is the actual habit you perform, which can take the form of a thought or an action.

Whether a response occurs depends on how motivated you are and how much friction is associated with the behavior. If a particular action requires more physical or mental effort than you are willing to expend, then you won’t do it.

It sounds simple, but a habit can occur only if you are capable of doing it.

Rewards are the end goal of every habit. The cue is about noticing the reward. The craving is about wanting the reward. The response is about obtaining the reward. We chase rewards because they serve two purposes: (1) they satisfy us and (2) they teach us.

Yes, rewards provide benefits on their own. Food and water deliver the energy you need to survive... ...But the more immediate benefit is that rewards satisfy your craving to eat.

At least for a moment, rewards deliver contentment and relief from craving.

Second, rewards teach us which actions are worth remembering in the future.

Feelings of pleasure and disappointment are part of the feedback mechanism that helps your brain distinguish useful actions from useless ones.

If a behavior is insufficient in any of the four stages, it will not become a habit.

Eliminate the cue and your habit will never start. Reduce the craving and you won’t experience enough motivation to act. Make the behavior difficult and you won’t be able to do it. And if the reward fails to satisfy your desire, then you’ll have no reason to do it again in the future.

Without the first three steps, a behavior will not occur. Without all four, a behavior will not be repeated.

![Figure 6](./figure6.jpg)

FIGURE 6: The four stages of habit are best described as a feedback loop. They form an endless cycle that is running every moment you are alive. This “habit loop” is continually scanning the environment, predicting what will happen next, trying out different responses, and learning from the results.

Together, these four steps form a neurological feedback loop—cue, craving, response, reward; cue, craving, response, reward—that ultimately allows you to create automatic habits. This cycle is known as the habit loop.

This four-step process... ...is running and active during every moment you are alive

We can split these four steps into two phases: the problem phase and the solution phase. The problem phase includes the cue and the craving, and it is when you realize that something needs to change. The solution phase includes the response and the reward, and it is when you take action and achieve the change you desire.

![Problem and solution phases](./problem_and_solution_phases.jpg)

All behavior is driven by the desire to solve a problem. 

Sometimes the problem is that you notice something good and you want to obtain it. Sometimes the problem is that you are experiencing pain and you want to relieve it.

By the time we become adults, we rarely notice the habits that are running our lives. Most of us never give a second thought to the fact that we tie the same shoe first each morning, or unplug the toaster after each use, or always change into comfortable clothes after getting home from work. After decades of mental programming, we automatically slip into these patterns of thinking and acting.

## The 1st Law Make It Obvious

## 4 The Man Who Didn’t Look Right

The human brain is a prediction machine. 5 It is continuously taking in your surroundings and analyzing the information it comes across.

Whenever you experience something repeatedly... ...your brain begins noticing what is important, sorting through the details and highlighting the relevant cues, and cataloging that information for future use. With enough practice, you can pick up on the cues that predict certain outcomes without consciously thinking about it.

We can’t always explain what it is we are learning, but learning is happening all along the way.

We underestimate how much our brains and bodies can do without thinking. You do not tell your hair to grow, your heart to pump, your lungs to breathe, or your stomach to digest. And yet your body handles all this and more on autopilot. You are much more than your conscious self.

You don’t need to be aware of the cue for a habit to begin. You can notice an opportunity and take action without dedicating conscious attention to it. This is what makes habits useful.

As habits form, your actions come under the direction of your automatic and nonconscious mind. You fall into old patterns before you realize what’s happening. Unless someone points it out, you may not notice that you cover your mouth with your hand whenever you laugh, that you apologize before asking a question, or that you have a habit of finishing other people’s sentences. And the more you repeat these patterns, the less likely you become to question what you’re doing and why you’re doing it.

We must begin the process of behavior change with awareness.

Before we can effectively build new habits, we need to get a handle on our current ones.

> -Carl Jung

### THE HABITS SCORECARD

_Pointing-and-Calling,_ is a safety system designed to reduce mistakes... ...reduces errors by up to 85 percent and cuts accidents by 30 percent... ...is so effective because it raises the level of awareness from a nonconscious habit to a more conscious level.

The more automatic a behavior becomes, the less likely we are to consciously think about it. And when we’ve done something a thousand times before, we begin to overlook things.

We’re so used to doing what we’ve always done that we don’t stop to question whether it’s the right thing to do at all.

Many of our failures in performance are largely attributable to a lack of self-awareness.

One of our greatest challenges in changing habits is maintaining awareness of what we are actually doing. This helps explain why the consequences of bad habits can sneak up on us. We need a “point-and-call” system for our personal lives. That’s the origin of the Habits Scorecard, which is a simple exercise you can use to become more aware of your behavior.

make a list of your daily habits... ...Once you have a full list, look at each behavior, and ask yourself, “Is this a good habit, a bad habit, or a neutral habit?” If it is a good habit, write “+” next to it. If it is a bad habit, write “–”. If it is a neutral habit, write “=”.

- Wake up = 
- Turn off alarm = 
- Check my phone – 
- Go to the bathroom = 
- Weigh myself + 
- Take a shower + 
- Brush my teeth + 
- Floss my teeth + 
- Put on deodorant + 
- Hang up towel to dry = 
- Get dressed = 
- Make a cup of tea +

The marks you give to a particular habit will depend on your situation and your goals... ...It all depends on what you’re working toward.

There are no good habits or bad habits. There are only effective habits. That is, effective at solving problems.

All habits serve you in some way—even the bad ones—which is why you repeat them.

Categorize your habits by how they will benefit you in the long run... ...Smoking a cigarette may reduce stress right now (that’s how it’s serving you), but it’s not a healthy long-term behavior.

how it’s serving you), but it’s not a healthy long-term behavior. If you’re still having trouble determining how to rate a particular habit, here is a question I like to use: “Does this behavior help me become the type of person I wish to be? Does this habit cast a vote for or against my desired identity?” Habits that reinforce your desired identity are usually good. Habits that conflict with your desired identity are usually bad.

As you create your Habits Scorecard, there is no need to change anything at first. The goal is to simply notice what is actually going on... ...Don’t blame yourself for your faults. Don’t praise yourself for your successes.

The first step to changing bad habits is to be on the lookout for them. If you feel like you need extra help, then you can try Pointing-and-Calling in your own life. Say out loud the action that you are thinking of taking and what the outcome will be.

If you want to cut back on your junk food habit but notice yourself grabbing another cookie, say out loud, “I’m about to eat this cookie, but I don’t need it. Eating it will cause me to gain weight and hurt my health.” Hearing your bad habits spoken aloud makes the consequences seem more real. It adds weight to the action rather than letting yourself mindlessly slip into an old routine.

The process of behavior change always starts with awareness.

Chapter Summary:
- With enough practice, your brain will pick up on the cues that predict certain outcomes without consciously thinking about it. 
- Once our habits become automatic, we stop paying attention to what we are doing. 
- The process of behavior change always starts with awareness. You need to be aware of your habits before you can change them. 
- Pointing-and-Calling raises your level of awareness from a nonconscious habit to a more conscious level by verbalizing your actions. 
- The Habits Scorecard is a simple exercise you can use to become more aware of your behavior.

## 5 The Best Way to Start a New Habit

_implementation intention,_ which is a plan you make beforehand about when and where to act. That is, how you intend to _implement_ a particular habit.

The cues that can trigger a habit come in a wide range of forms—the feel of your phone buzzing in your pocket, the smell of chocolate chip cookies, the sound of ambulance sirens—but the two most common cues are time and location. Implementation intentions leverage both of these cues.

Broadly speaking, the format for creating an implementation intention is: “When situation X arises, I will perform response Y.”

People who make a specific plan for when and where they will perform a new habit are more likely to follow through.

Too many people try to change their habits without these basic details figured out. We tell ourselves, “I’m going to eat healthier” or “I’m going to write more,” but we never say when and where these habits are going to happen. We leave it up to chance and hope that we will “just remember to do it” or feel motivated at the right time.

Many people think they lack motivation when what they really lack is clarity. It is not always obvious when and where to take action. Some people spend their entire lives waiting for the time to be right to make an improvement.

Once an implementation intention has been set, you don’t have to wait for inspiration to strike... ...When the moment of action occurs, there is no need to make a decision. Simply follow your predetermined plan.

Fill out this sentence: I will [BEHAVIOR] at [TIME] in [LOCATION]. Example: Meditation. I will meditate for one minute at 7 a.m. in my kitchen.

If we have hope, we have a reason to take action. A fresh start feels motivating.

Being specific about what you want and how you will achieve it helps you say no to things that derail progress, distract your attention, and pull you off course.

When your dreams are vague, it’s easy to rationalize little exceptions all day long and never get around to the specific things you need to do to succeed.

The goal is to make the time and location so obvious that, with enough repetition, you get an urge to do the right thing at the right time, even if you can’t say why.

### HABIT STACKING: A SIMPLE PLAN TO OVERHAUL YOUR HABITS

The Diderot Effect states that obtaining a new possession often creates a spiral of consumption that leads to additional purchases.

Many human behaviors follow this cycle. You often decide what to do next based on what you have just finished doing.

No behavior happens in isolation. Each action becomes a cue that triggers the next behavior.

One of the best ways to build a new habit is to identify a current habit you already do each day and then stack your new behavior on top. This is called _habit stacking._

The habit stacking formula is: “After [CURRENT HABIT], I will [NEW HABIT].”

The key is to tie your desired behavior into something you already do each day.

Once you have mastered this basic structure, you can begin to create larger stacks by chaining small habits together. This allows you to take advantage of the natural momentum that comes from one behavior leading into the next—a positive version of the Diderot Effect. 

![Figure 7](./figure7.jpg)

FIGURE 7: Habit stacking increases the likelihood that you’ll stick with a habit by stacking your new behavior on top of an old one. This process can be repeated to chain numerous habits together, each one acting as the cue for the next.

Habit stacking allows you to create a set of simple rules that guide your future behavior. It’s like you always have a game plan for which action should come next.


Strategy, the secret to creating a successful habit stack is selecting the right cue to kick things off.

Unlike an implementation intention, which specifically states the time and location for a given behavior, habit stacking implicitly has the time and location built into.

Don’t ask yourself to do a habit when you’re likely to be occupied with something else.

Your cue should also have the same frequency as your desired habit. If you want to do a habit every day, but you stack it on top of a habit that only happens on Mondays, that’s not a good choice.

Habit stacking works best when the cue is highly specific and immediately actionable.

Habits like “read more” or “eat better” are worthy causes, but these goals do not provide instruction on how and when to act. Be specific and clear:... ...The specificity is important. 

The more tightly bound your new habit is to a specific cue, the better the odds are that you will notice when the time comes to act.

The 1st Law of Behavior Change is to _make it obvious._ Strategies like implementation intentions and habit stacking are among the most practical ways to create obvious cues for your habits and design a clear plan for when and where to take action.
