a·tom·ic 

1. an extremely small amount of a thing; the single irreducible unit of a larger system. 
2. the source of immense energy or power. 

hab·it

1. a routine or practice performed regularly; an automatic response to a specific situation.

## Introduction: My Story 

ON THE FINAL day of my sophomore year of high school, I was hit in the face with a baseball bat... ...After yet another seizure—my third of the day—I was put into a medically induced coma and placed on a ventilator... ...My mother would tell me later, “It was one of the worst nights I’ve ever had.”

### MY RECOVERY

By the next morning my breathing had rebounded to the point where the doctors felt comfortable releasing me from the coma... ...The following months were hard. It felt like everything in my life was on pause... ...Despite my lackluster high school career, I still believed I could become a great player. And I knew that if things were going to improve, I was the one responsible for making it happen.

### HOW I LEARNED ABOUT HABITS

Good sleep habits and went to bed early each night... ...keep my room neat and tidy. These improvements were minor, but they gave me a sense of control over my life. I started to feel confident again... ...A habit is a routine or behavior that is performed regularly—and, in many cases, automatically.

I fulfilled my potential.

We all face challenges in life.

Changes that seem small and unimportant at first will compound into remarkable results if you’re willing to stick with them for years.

In the long run, the quality of our lives often depends on the quality of our habits.

With the same habits, you’ll end up with the same results. But with better habits, anything is possible.

The only way I made progress—the only choice I had—was to start small.

### HOW AND WHY I WROTE THIS BOOK

In 2014, my email list expanded to over one hundred thousand subscribers, which made it one of the fastest-growing newsletters on the internet. I had felt like an impostor when I began writing two years earlier, but now I was becoming known as an expert on habits—a new label that excited me but also felt uncomfortable.

As I put the finishing touches on this book in 2018, jamesclear.com is receiving millions of visitors per month and nearly five hundred thousand people subscribe to my weekly email newsletter—a number that is so far beyond my expectations when I began that I’m not even sure what to think of it.

### HOW THIS BOOK WILL BENEFIT YOU

Naval Ravikant has said, “To write a great book, you must first become the book.”

Small habits helped me fulfill my potential,

In the pages that follow, I will share a step-by-step plan for building better habits—not for days or weeks, but for a lifetime.

This book... ...it’s an operating manual. You’ll find wisdom and practical advice front and center as I explain the science of how to create and change your habits in a way that is easy to understand and apply.

The backbone of this book is my four-step model of habits—cue, craving, response, and reward—and the four laws of behavior change that evolve out of these steps.

Behavioral scientists like Skinner realized that if you offered the right reward or punishment, you could get people to act in a certain way. But while Skinner’s model did an excellent job of explaining how external stimuli influenced our habits, it lacked a good explanation for how our thoughts, feelings, and beliefs impact our behavior. Internal states—our moods and emotions—matter, too. In recent decades, scientists have begun to determine the connection between our thoughts, feelings, and behavior.

Human behavior is always changing: situation to situation, moment to moment, second to second. But this book is about what _doesn’t_ change. It’s about the fundamentals of human behavior.

As long as human behavior is involved, this book will be your guide.

## The Fundamentals Why Tiny Changes Make a Big Difference

## 1 The Surprising Power of Atomic Habits

Brailsford said, “The whole principle came from the idea that if you broke down everything you could think of that goes into riding a bike, and then improve it by 1 percent, you will get a significant increase when you put them all together.”

Why do small improvements accumulate into such remarkable results, and how can you replicate this approach in your own life?

### WHY SMALL HABITS MAKE A BIG DIFFERENCE

It is so easy to overestimate the importance of one defining moment and underestimate the value of making small improvements on a daily basis.

Too often, we convince ourselves that massive success requires massive action.

Improving by 1 percent isn’t particularly notable—sometimes it isn’t even _noticeable_ —but it can be far more meaningful, especially in the long run.

If you can get 1 percent better each day for one year, you’ll end up thirty-seven times better by the time you’re done. Conversely, if you get 1 percent worse each day for one year, you’ll decline nearly down to zero.

![Figure 1](./figure1.jpg)

FIGURE 1: The effects of small habits compound over time. For example, if you can get just 1 percent better each day, you’ll end up with results that are nearly 37 times better after one year.

Habits are the compound interest of self-improvement.

The effects of your habits multiply as you repeat them. They seem to make little difference on any given day and yet the impact they deliver over the months and years can be enormous.

It is only when looking back two, five, or perhaps ten years later that the value of good habits and the cost of bad ones becomes strikingly apparent.

We make a few changes, but the results never seem to come quickly and so we slide back into our previous routines.

Unfortunately, the slow pace of transformation also makes it easy to let a bad habit slide.

But when we repeat 1 percent errors, day after day, by replicating poor decisions, duplicating tiny mistakes, and rationalizing little excuses, our small choices compound into toxic results.

It’s the accumulation of many missteps—a 1 percent decline here and there—that eventually leads to a problem.

The impact created by a change in your habits is similar to the effect of shifting the route of an airplane by just a few degrees.

Imagine you are flying from Los Angeles to New York City. If a pilot leaving from LAX adjusts the heading just 3.5 degrees south, you will land in Washington, D.C., instead of New York. Such a small change is barely noticeable at takeoff—the nose of the airplane moves just a few feet—but when magnified across the entire United States, you end up hundreds of miles apart.

A slight change in your daily habits can guide your life to a very different destination.

Making a choice that is 1 percent better or 1 percent worse seems insignificant in the moment, but over the span of moments that make up a lifetime these choices determine the difference between who you are and who you could be.

Success is the product of daily habits—not once-in-a-lifetime transformations.

What matters is whether your habits are putting you on the path toward success. 

You should be far more concerned with your current trajectory than with your current results.

Your outcomes are a lagging measure of your habits.

Your net worth is a lagging measure of your financial habits. Your weight is a lagging measure of your eating habits. Your knowledge is a lagging measure of your learning habits... ...You get what you repeat.

If you want to predict where you’ll end up in life, all you have to do is follow the curve of tiny gains or tiny losses, and see how your daily choices will compound ten or twenty years down the line.

Time magnifies the margin between success and failure. It will multiply whatever you feed it. Good habits make time your ally. Bad habits make time your enemy.

Habits are a double-edged sword. 15 Bad habits can cut you down just as easily as good habits can build you up, which is why understanding the details is crucial. You need to know how habits work and how to design them to your liking, so you can avoid the dangerous half of the blade.

### YOUR HABITS CAN COMPOUND FOR YOU OR AGAINST YOU

| Positive Compounding | Negative Compounding |
| -------------------- | -------------------- |
| **Productivity compounds.**... ...The effect of automating an old task or mastering a new skill can be even greater. The more tasks you can handle without thinking, the more your brain is free to focus on other areas. | **Stress compounds.**... ...common causes of stress are manageable. But when they persist for years, little stresses compound into serious health issues.|
| **Knowledge compounds.**... ...a commitment to lifelong learning can be transformative. Furthermore, each book you read not only teaches you something new but also opens up different ways of thinking about old ideas. | **Negative thoughts compound.** The more you think of yourself as worthless, stupid, or ugly, the more you condition yourself to interpret life that way. You get trapped in a thought loop. The same is true for how you think about others. Once you fall into the habit of seeing people as angry, unjust, or selfish, you see those kind of people everywhere. |
| **Relationships compound.** People reflect your behavior back to you. The more you help others, the more others want to help you. Being a little bit nicer in each interaction can result in a network of broad and strong connections over time. | **Outrage compounds.**... ...series of microaggressions and daily aggravations slowly multiply until one event tips the scales and outrage spreads like wildfire. |

> “That’s how knowledge works. It builds up, like compound interest.”
> -Warren Buffett
 
### WHAT PROGRESS IS REALLY LIKE

Imagine that you have an ice cube sitting on the table in front of you. The room is cold and you can see your breath. It is currently twenty-five degrees. Ever so slowly, the room begins to heat up. Twenty-six degrees. Twenty-seven. Twenty-eight. The ice cube is still sitting on the table in front of you. Twenty-nine degrees. Thirty. Thirty-one. Still, nothing has happened. Then, thirty-two degrees. The ice begins to melt. A one-degree shift, seemingly no different from the temperature increases before it, has unlocked a huge change.

Breakthrough moments are often the result of many previous actions, which build up the potential required to unleash a major change.

Bamboo can barely be seen for the first five years as it builds extensive root systems underground before exploding ninety feet into the air within six weeks.

Habits often appear to make no difference until you cross a critical threshold and unlock a new level of performance.

It’s frustrating how ineffective changes can seem during the first days, weeks, and even months. It doesn’t feel like you are going anywhere... ...the most powerful outcomes are delayed.

It is so hard to build habits that last. People make a few small changes, fail to see a tangible result, and decide to stop.

in order to make a meaningful difference, habits need to persist long enough to break through this plateau—what I call the _Plateau of Latent Potential._ 

If you find yourself struggling to build a good habit or break a bad one, it is not because you have lost your ability to improve. It is often because you have not yet crossed the Plateau of Latent Potential.

When you finally break through the Plateau of Latent Potential, people... ...only sees the most dramatic event rather than all that preceded it. But you know that it’s the work you did long ago—when... ...progress—that makes the jump today possible.

Mastery requires patience.

> Jacob Riis hanging in their locker room: “When nothing seems to help, I go and look at a stonecutter hammering away at his rock, perhaps a hundred times without as much as a crack showing in it. 19 Yet at the hundred and first blow it will split in two, and I know it was not that last blow that did it—but all that had gone before.”
> -Jacob Riis
 
![Figure 2](./figure2.jpg)

FIGURE 2: We often expect progress to be linear... ...In reality, the results of our efforts are often delayed... ...This can result in a “valley of disappointment” where people feel discouraged after putting in weeks or months of hard work without experiencing any results. However, this work was not wasted... ...It is not until much later that the full value of previous efforts is revealed.

All big things come from small beginnings.

The seed of every habit is a single, tiny decision. But as that decision is repeated, a habit sprouts and grows stronger.

The task of breaking a bad habit is like uprooting a powerful oak within us. And the task of building a good habit is like cultivating a delicate flower one day at a time.

### FORGET ABOUT GOALS, FOCUS ON SYSTEMS INSTEAD

Prevailing wisdom claims that the best way to achieve what we want in life... ...is to set specific, actionable goals. For many years, this was how I approached my habits, too... ...Eventually, I began to realize that my results had very little to do with the goals I set and nearly everything to do with the systems I followed.

What’s the difference between systems and goals?... ...Goals are about the results you want to achieve. Systems are about the processes that lead to those results.

Now for the interesting question: If you completely ignored your goals and focused only on your system, would you still succeed?... ...I think you would.

> “The score takes care of itself.”
> Bill Walsh
 
If you want better results, then forget about setting goals. Focus on your system instead.

Goals are good for setting a direction, but systems are best for making progress.

A handful of problems arise when you spend too much time thinking about your goals and not enough time designing your systems.

**Problem #1: Winners and losers have the same goals.**

If successful and unsuccessful people share the same goals, then the goal cannot be what differentiates the winners from the losers.

It wasn’t the _goal_... ...The goal had always been there. It was only when they implemented a _system_ of continuous small improvements that they achieved a different outcome.

**Problem #2: Achieving a goal is only a momentary change.**

Imagine you have a messy room and you set a goal to clean it. If you summon the energy to tidy up, then you will have a clean room—for now. But if you maintain the same sloppy, pack-rat habits that led to a messy room in the first place, soon you’ll be looking at a new pile of clutter and hoping for another burst of motivation.

You’re left chasing the same outcome because you never changed the system behind it.

You treated a symptom without addressing the cause.

Achieving a goal only changes your life _for the moment._

We think we need to change our results, but the results are not the problem. What we really need to change are the systems that cause those results.

When you solve problems at the results level, you only solve them temporarily. In order to improve for good, you need to solve problems at the systems level.

Fix the inputs and the outputs will fix themselves.

**Problem #3: Goals restrict your happiness.**

The implicit assumption behind any goal is this: “Once I reach my goal, then I’ll be happy.” The problem with a goals-first mentality is that you’re continually putting happiness off until the next milestone.

Furthermore, goals create an “either-or” conflict: either you achieve your goal and are successful or you fail and you are a disappointment. 

You mentally box yourself into a narrow version of happiness. This is misguided. 

It is unlikely that your actual path through life will match the exact journey you had in mind when you set out.

It makes no sense to restrict your satisfaction to one scenario when there are many paths to success.

When you fall in love with the process rather than the product, you don’t have to wait to give yourself permission to be happy. You can be satisfied anytime your system is running.

A system can be successful in many different forms, not just the one you first envision.

**Problem #4: Goals are at odds with long-term progress.**

When all of your hard work is focused on a particular goal, what is left to push you forward after you achieve it? This is why many people find themselves reverting to their old habits after accomplishing a goal. 

The purpose of setting goals is to win the game. The purpose of building systems is to continue playing the game. 

True long-term thinking is goal-less thinking.

It is about the cycle of endless refinement and continuous improvement. 

Ultimately, it is your commitment to the _process_ that will determine your _progress._

### A SYSTEM OF ATOMIC HABITS

If you’re having trouble changing your habits, the problem isn’t you. The problem is your system. 

Bad habits repeat themselves again and again not because you don’t want to change, but because you have the wrong system for change. 

You do not rise to the level of your goals. You fall to the level of your systems.

Atomic habits... ...are little habits that are part of a larger system. Just as atoms are the building blocks of molecules, atomic habits are the building blocks of remarkable results.

At first, these tiny routines seem insignificant, but soon they build on each other and fuel bigger wins that multiply to a degree that far outweighs the cost of their initial investment.

_atomic habits_ —a regular practice or routine that is not only small and easy to do, but also the source of incredible power; a component of the system of compound growth.

## 2 How Your Habits Shape Your Identity (and Vice Versa)

WHY IS IT so easy to repeat bad habits and so hard to form good ones?

It often feels difficult to keep good habits going for more than a few days, even with sincere effort and the occasional burst of motivation.

once your habits are established, they seem to stick around forever—especially the unwanted ones.

Changing our habits is challenging for two reasons: (1) we try to change the wrong thing and (2) we try to change our habits in the wrong way.

Our first mistake is that we try to change the wrong thing... ...consider that there are three levels at which change can occur. You can imagine them like the layers of an onion.
 
![Figure 3](./figure3.jpg)

FIGURE 3: There are three layers of behavior change: a change in your outcomes, a change in your processes, or a change in your identity.

**The first layer is changing your outcomes.** This level is concerned with changing your results:... ...Most of the goals you set are associated with this level of change... ...**The second layer is changing your process.** This level is concerned with changing your habits and systems:... ...Most of the habits you build are associated with this level. **The third and deepest layer is changing your identity.** This level is concerned with changing your beliefs:... ...Most of the beliefs, assumptions, and biases you hold are associated with this level.

Outcomes are about what you get. Processes are about what you do. Identity is about what you believe.

When it comes to building habits that last... ...the problem is not that one level is “better” or “worse” than another. All levels of change are useful in their own way. The problem is the _direction_ of change.

Many people begin the process of changing their habits by focusing on _what_ they want to achieve. This leads us to outcome-based habits. The alternative is to build identity-based habits. With this approach, we start by focusing on _who_ we wish to become.

![Figure 4](./figure4.jpg)

FIGURE 4: With outcome-based habits, the focus is on what you want to achieve. With identity-based habits, the focus is on who you wish to become.

Imagine two people resisting a cigarette. When offered a smoke, the first person says, “No thanks. I’m trying to quit.” It sounds like a reasonable response, but this person still believes they are a smoker who is trying to be something else. They are hoping their behavior will change while carrying around the same beliefs. The second person declines by saying, “No thanks. I’m not a smoker.” It’s a small difference, but this statement signals a shift in identity. Smoking was part of their former life, not their current one. They no longer identify as someone who smokes.

Most people don’t even consider identity change when they set out to improve... ...They set goals and determine the actions they should take to achieve those goals without considering the beliefs that drive their actions. They never shift the way they look at themselves, and they don’t realize that their old identity can sabotage their new plans for change.

Behind every system of actions are a system of beliefs.

There are a set of beliefs and assumptions that shape the system, an identity behind the habits. 

Behavior that is incongruent with the self will not last.

You may want better health, but if you continue to prioritize comfort over accomplishment, you’ll be drawn to relaxing rather than training. 

It’s hard to change your habits if you never change the underlying beliefs that led to your past behavior. You have a new goal and a new plan, but you haven’t changed _who_ you are.

The ultimate form of intrinsic motivation is when a habit becomes part of your identity. It’s one thing to say I’m the type of person who _wants_ this. It’s something very different to say I’m the type of person who is this. 

The more pride you have in a particular aspect of your identity, the more motivated you will be to maintain the habits associated with it.

True behavior change is identity change. 

You might start a habit because of motivation, but the only reason you’ll stick with one is that it becomes part of your identity. 

Anyone can convince themselves to visit the gym or eat healthy once or twice, but if you don’t shift the belief behind the behavior, then it is hard to stick with long-term changes. 

Improvements are only temporary until they become part of who you are.

The goal is not to read a book, the goal is to _become_ a reader.

What you do is an indication of the type of person you believe that you are.

Once a person believes in a particular aspect of their identity, they are more likely to act in alignment with that belief.

Doing the right thing is easy. After all, when your behavior and your identity are fully aligned, you are no longer pursuing behavior change. You are simply acting like the type of person you already believe yourself to be.

When working against you, though, identity change can be a curse. Once you have adopted an identity, it can be easy to let your allegiance to it impact your ability to change.

Many people walk through life in a cognitive slumber, blindly following the norms attached to their identity. “I’m terrible with directions.” “I’m not a morning person.” ...and a thousand other variations.

The more deeply a thought or action is tied to your identity, the more difficult it is to change it.

It can feel comfortable to believe what your culture believes (group identity) or to do what upholds your self-image (personal identity), even if it’s wrong.

The biggest barrier to positive change at any level—individual.

Good habits can make rational sense, but if they conflict with your identity, you will fail to put them into action.

On any given day, you may struggle with your habits... ...Over the long run, however, the real reason you fail to stick with habits is that your self-image gets in the way.

Progress requires unlearning. 

Becoming the best version of yourself requires you to continuously edit your beliefs, and to upgrade and expand your identity.

If your beliefs and worldview play such an important role in your behavior, where do they come from in the first place? How, exactly, is your identity formed? And how can you emphasize new aspects of your identity that serve you and gradually erase the pieces that hinder you?

### THE TWO-STEP PROCESS TO CHANGING YOUR IDENTITY

Your identity emerges out of your habits.

You are not born with preset beliefs. Every belief, including those about yourself, is learned and conditioned through experience.

Your habits are how you embody your identity. When you make your bed each day, you embody the identity of an organized person.

The more you repeat a behavior, the more you reinforce the identity associated with that behavior.

The word _identity_ was originally derived from the Latin words _essentitas,_ which means _being,_ and _identidem,_ which means _repeatedly._ Your identity is literally your “repeated beingness.”

If you go to the gym even when it’s snowing, you have evidence that you are committed to fitness. The more evidence you have for a belief, the more strongly you will believe it.

I published a new article every Monday and Thursday for the first few years. As the evidence grew, so did my identity as a writer. I didn’t start out as a writer. I _became_ one through my habits.

As you repeat these actions, however, the evidence accumulates and your self-image begins to change.

Your habits contribute most of the evidence that shapes your identity. In this way, the process of building habits is actually the process of becoming yourself.


This is a gradual evolution... ...We change bit by bit, day by day, habit by habit. We are continually undergoing microevolutions of the self... ...If you finish a book, then perhaps you are the type of person who likes reading... ...Every action you take is a vote for the type of person you wish to become.
