## Preface by Harold S. Kushner

If a book has one passage, one idea with the power to change a person’s life, that alone justifies reading and re-reading it and finding room for it on one’s shelves.

> He who has a Why to live for can bear almost any How.
> — Nietzsche

Who had lost all hope for a future... ...died less from lack of food... ...than from... ...lack of something to live for.

Life is not primarily a quest for pleasure, as Freud believed, or a quest for power, as Alfred Adler taught, but a quest for meaning.

The great task for any person is to find meaning in his or her life.

We give our suffering meaning by the way in which we respond to it.

A person “may remain brave, dignified and unselfish, or in the bitter fight for self-preservation he may forget his human dignity and become no more than an animal.”

Forces beyond your control can take away everything you possess except one thing, your freedom to choose how you will respond to the situation.

You cannot control what happens to you in life, but you can always control what you will feel and do about what happens to you.

Life is meaningful and... ...we must learn to see life as meaningful despite our circumstances... ...there is an ultimate purpose to life.

> Our generation is realistic, for we have come to know man as he really is. After all, man is that being who invented the gas chambers of Auschwitz; however, he is also that being who entered those gas chambers upright, with the Lord’s Prayer or the Shema Yisrael on his lips.
> — Harold S. Kushner

## Preface to the 1992 Edition

For success, like happiness, cannot be pursued; it must ensue, and it only does so as the unintended side-effect of one’s dedication to a cause greater than oneself.

Happiness must happen, and the same holds for success: you have to let it happen by not caring about it... ...Then you will live to see that in the long run... ...success will follow you precisely because you had _forgotten_ to think of it.

## PART ONE: Experiences in a Concentration Camp 

Capos—prisoners who acted as trustees, having special privileges—... ...were never hungry... ...were chosen only from those prisoners whose characters promised to make them suitable for such procedures, and if they did not comply with what was expected of them, they were immediately demoted.

The best of us did not return.

Former prisoners often say, “We dislike talking about our experiences. No explanations are needed for those who have been inside, and the others will understand neither how we felt then nor how we feel now.”

We were practically sold as slaves: the firm paid the camp authorities a fixed price per day, per prisoner.

The cigarettes could be exchanged for twelve soups, and twelve soups were often a very real respite from starvation... ...Thus, when we saw a comrade smoking his own cigarettes, we knew he had given up faith in his strength to carry on, and, once lost, the will to live seldom returned.
