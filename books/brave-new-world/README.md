## eForeword

> Utopias seem to be much more attainable than one would have believed in other times. And we currently find ourselves faced with a different kind of agonizing question: How can one avoid their definitive attainment? … Utopias are attainable. Life leads us toward utopias. Perhaps a new century will begin, a century in which the intellectuals and the cultivated classes will dream again of ways to avoid utopias and to return to a non-utopian society, one less “perfect” and more free.

## Chapter 1

The eggs which it contained were inspected for abnormalities, counted and transferred to a porous receptacle; how (and he now took them to watch the operation) this receptacle was immersed in a warm bouillon containing free-swimming spermatozoa—at a minimum concentration of one hundred thousand per cubic centimetre.

Alphas and Betas remained until definitely bottled; while the Gammas, Deltas and Epsilons were brought out again, after only thirty-six hours, to undergo Bokanovsky’s Process.

One egg, one embryo, one adult—normality. But a bokanovskified egg will bud, will proliferate, will divide. From eight to ninety-six... ...into a full-sized adult. Making ninety-six human beings grow where only one grew before. Progress.

"If we could bokanovskify indefinitely the whole problem would be solved.”... ...The principle of mass production at last applied to biology.

In exceptional cases we can make one ovary yield us over fifteen thousand adult individuals.

“For of course,” said Mr. Foster, “in the vast majority of cases, fertility is merely a nuisance."

Freemartins—structurally quite normal (except,” he had to admit, “that they _do_ have the slightest tendency to grow beards), but sterile. Guaranteed sterile. Which brings us at last,” continued Mr. Foster, “out of the realm of mere slavish imitation of nature into the much more interesting world of human invention.”

If the physical development could be speeded up till it was as quick, say, as a cow’s, what an enormous saving to the Community!

Pilkington, at Mombasa, had produced individuals who were sexually mature at four and full-grown at six and a half. A scientific triumph. But socially useless. Six-year-old men and women were too stupid to do even Epsilon work. And the process was an all-or-nothing one; either you failed to modify at all, or else you modified the whole way. They were still trying to find the ideal compromise between adults of twenty and adults of six. So far without success.

“And that,” put in the Director sententiously, “that is the secret of happiness and virtue—liking what you’ve got to do. All conditioning aims at that: making people like their un-escapable social destiny.”

## Chapter 2

The children started, screamed; their faces were distorted with terror. “And now,” the Director shouted (for the noise was deafening), “now we proceed to rub in the lesson with a mild electric shock.”

What man has joined, nature is powerless to put asunder.

“They’ll grow up with what the psychologists used to call an ‘instinctive’ hatred of books and flowers. Reflexes unalterably conditioned. They’ll be safe from books and botany all their lives.”

If the children were made to scream at the sight of a rose, that was on grounds of high economic policy. Not so very long ago (a century or thereabouts), Gammas, Deltas, even Epsilons, had been conditioned to like flowers—flowers in particular and wild nature in general. The idea was to make them want to be going out into the country at every available opportunity, and so compel them to consume transport. “And didn’t they consume transport?” asked the student. “Quite a lot,” the D.H.C. replied. “But nothing else.” Primroses and landscapes, he pointed out, have one grave defect: they are gratuitous. A love of nature keeps no factories busy. It was decided to abolish the love of nature, at any rate among the lower classes; to abolish the love of nature, but not the tendency to consume transport. For of course it was essential that they should keep on going to the country, even though they hated it. The problem was to find an economically sounder reason for consuming transport than a mere affection for primroses and landscapes. It was duly found. “We condition the masses to hate the country,” concluded the Director. “But simultaneously we condition them to love all country sports. At the same time, we see to it that all country sports shall entail the use of elaborate apparatus. So that they consume manufactured articles as well as transport.

“Human beings used to be …” he hesitated; the blood rushed to his cheeks. “Well they used to be viviparous.” “Quite right.” The Director nodded approvingly. “And when the babies were decanted …” “‘Born,’” came the correction. “Well, then they were the parents—I mean, not the babies, of course; the other ones.” The poor boy was overwhelmed with confusion.

For that there must be words, but words without reason. In brief, hypnopædia. “The greatest moralizing and socializing force of all time.”... ...Not so much like drops of water, though water, it is true, can wear holes in the hardest granite; rather, drops of liquid sealing-wax, drops that adhere, incrust, incorporate themselves with what they fall on, till finally the rock is all one scarlet blob. “Till at last the child’s mind is these suggestions, and the sum of the suggestions is the child’s mind. And not the child’s mind only. The adult’s mind too—all his life long. The mind that judges and desires and decides—made up of these suggestions. But all these suggestions are _our_ suggestions!”... ...“Suggestions from the State.”

## Chapter 3

“strange to think that... ...most games were played without more apparatus than a ball or two and a few sticks and perhaps a bit of netting. Imagine the folly of allowing people to play elaborate games which do nothing whatever to increase consumption. It’s madness. Nowadays the Controllers won’t approve of any new game unless it can be shown that it requires at least as much apparatus as the most complicated of existing games.”

History is bunk. History,” he repeated slowly, “is bunk.”

Those who feel themselves despised do well to look despising.

“Try to realize what it was like to have a viviparous mother.”

whenever he spoke of psychological matters—Our Freud had been the first to reveal the appalling dangers of family life. The world was full of fathers—was therefore full of misery; full of mothers—therefore of every kind of perversion from sadism to chastity; full of brothers, sisters, uncles, aunts—full of madness and suicide. “And yet, among the savages of Samoa, in certain islands off the coast of New Guinea …” The tropical sunshine lay like warm honey on the naked bodies of children tumbling promiscuously among the hibiscus blossoms. Home was in any one of twenty palm-thatched houses. In the Trobriands conception was the work of ancestral ghosts; nobody had ever heard of a father. “Extremes,” said the Controller, “meet. For the good reason that they were made to meet.”

“But every one belongs to every one else,” he concluded, citing the hypnopædic proverb. The students nodded, emphatically agreeing with a statement which upwards of sixty-two thousand repetitions in the dark had made them accept, not merely as true, but as axiomatic, self-evident, utterly indisputable.

Mother, monogamy, romance. High spurts the fountain; fierce and foamy the wild jet. The urge has but a single outlet. My love, my baby. No wonder these poor pre-moderns were mad and wicked and miserable. Their world didn’t allow them to take things easily, didn’t allow them to be sane, virtuous, happy. What with mothers and lovers, what with the prohibitions they were not conditioned to obey, what with the temptations and the lonely remorses, what with all the diseases and the endless isolating pain, what with the uncertainties and the poverty—they were forced to feel strongly. And feeling strongly (and strongly, what was more, in solitude, in hopelessly individual isolation), how could they be stable?

"stability. No civilization without social stability. No social stability without individual stability.”

“Stability,” insisted the Controller, “stability. The primal and the ultimate need. Stability. Hence all this.”

“Take Ectogenesis. Pfitzner and Kawaguchi had got the whole technique worked out. But would the Governments look at it? No. There was something called Christianity. Women were forced to go on being viviparous.”

“Or the Caste System. Constantly proposed, constantly rejected. There was something called democracy. As though men were more than physico-chemically equal.”

“Government’s an affair of sitting, not hitting. You rule with the brains and the buttocks, never with the fists. For example, there was the conscription of consumption.”

"Ending is better than mending. The more stitches, the less riches"

“Back to culture. Yes, actually to culture. You can’t consume much if you sit still and read books.”

“The discoveries of Pfitzner and Kawaguchi were at last made use of. An intensive propaganda against viviparous reproduction …”

“Accompanied by a campaign against the Past; by the closing of museums, the blowing up of historical monuments (luckily most of them had already been destroyed during the Nine Years’ War); by the suppression of all books published before A.F . 150.”

“All crosses had their tops cut and became T’s. There was also a thing called God.”

“There was a thing called the soul and a thing called immortality.”

“Two thousand pharmacologists and bio-chemists were subsidized in A.F . 178.”... ...“Six years later it was being produced commercially. The perfect drug.”... ...“Euphoric, narcotic, pleasantly hallucinant.”... ..._soma_... ...“All the advantages of Christianity and alcohol; none of their defects.”... ...“And do remember that a gramme is better than a damn.”

“Work, play—at sixty our powers and tastes are what they were at seventeen. Old men in the bad old days used to renounce, retire, take to religion, spend their time reading, thinking— _thinking_!

## Chapter 4

The liftman was a small simian creature, dressed in the black tunic of an Epsilon-Minus Semi-Moron. “Roof.” He flung open the gates. The warm glory of afternoon sunlight made him start and blink his eyes. “Oh, roof!” he repeated in a voice of rapture. He was as though suddenly and joyfully awakened from a dark annihilating stupor. “Roof.” He smiled up with a kind of doggily expectant adoration into the faces of his passengers. Talking and laughing together, they stepped out into the light. The liftman looked after them.

Benito was notoriously good-natured. People said of him that he could have got through life without ever touching soma . The malice and bad tempers from which other people had to take holidays never afflicted him. Reality for Benito was always sunny.

Sex-hormone chewing-gum, stuffed a plug into his cheek and walked slowly away towards the hangars, ruminating.

Like the vague torsos of fabulous athletes, huge fleshy clouds lolled on the blue air above their heads. Out of one of them suddenly dropped a small scarlet insect, buzzing as it fell. “There’s the Red Rocket,” said Henry, “just come in from New York.” Looking at his watch. “Seven minutes behind time,” he added, and shook his head. “These Atlantic services—they’re really scandalously unpunctual.”

Henry pushed at a lever; there was a click. Slowly at first, then faster and faster, till it was a circular mist before their eyes, the propeller in front of them began to revolve. The wind of a horizontal speed whistled ever more shrilly in the stays. Henry kept his eye on the revolution-counter; when the needle touched the twelve hundred mark, he threw the helicopter screws out of gear. The machine had enough forward momentum to be able to fly on its planes.

## Chapter 5

Those who meant well behaved in the same way as those who meant badly.

The hangars were staffed by a single Bokanovsky Group, and the men were twins, identically small, black and hideous.

“I am I, and wish I wasn’t”; his self-consciousness was acute and distressing.

For Gammas, Deltas and Epsilons had been to some extent conditioned to associate corporeal mass with social superiority.

The various Bureaux of Propaganda and the College of Emotional Engineering were housed in a single sixty-story building in Fleet Street. In the basement and on the lower floors were the presses and offices of the three great London newspapers—_The Hourly Radio,_ an upper-caste sheet, in pale green _Gamma Gazette,_ and, on khaki paper and in words exclusively of one syllable, _The Delta Mirror._ Then came the Bureaux of Propaganda by Television, by Feeling Picture, and by Synthetic Voice and Music respectively—twenty-two floors of them. Above were the research laboratories and the padded rooms in which the Sound-Track Writers and Synthetic Composers did their delicate work. The top eighteen floors were occupied by the College of Emotional Engineering.

By profession he was a lecturer at the College of Emotional Engineering (Department of Writing) and in the intervals of his educational activities, a working Emotional Engineer. He wrote regularly for _The Hourly Radio,_ composed feely scenarios, and had the happiest knack for slogans and hypnopædic rhymes.

This admirable committee man and best mixer had realized quite suddenly that sport, women, communal activities were only, so far as he was concerned, second bests.

A physical shortcoming could produce a kind of mental excess. The process, it seemed, was reversible. Mental excess could produce, for its own purposes, the voluntary blindness and deafness of deliberate solitude, the artificial impotence of asceticism.

Words can be like X-rays, if you use them properly—they’ll go through anything. You read and you’re pierced.

Can you say something about nothing?

## Chapter 6

“Phosphorous recovery,” explained Henry telegraphically. “On their way up the chimney the gases go through four separate treatments. P 2 O 5 used to go right out of circulation every time they cremated some one. Now they recover over ninety-eight per cent of it. More than a kilo and a half per adult corpse. Which makes the best part of four hundred tons of phosphorous every year from England alone.” Henry spoke with a happy pride, rejoicing wholeheartedly in the achievement, as though it had been his own. “Fine to think we can go on being socially useful even after we’re dead. Making plants grow.”

“Every one works for every one else. We can’t do without any one. Even Epsilons are useful. We couldn’t do without Epsilons.

“I suppose Epsilons don’t really mind being Epsilons,” she said aloud. “Of course they don’t. How can they? They don’t know what it’s like being anything else. We’d mind, of course. But then we’ve been differently conditioned. Besides, we start with a different heredity.” “I’m glad I’m not an Epsilon,” said Lenina, with conviction. “And if you were an Epsilon,” said Henry, “your conditioning would have made you no less thankful that you weren’t a Beta or an Alpha.”

“It was some human being finally and definitely disappearing. Going up in a squirt of hot gas. It would be curious to know who it was—a man or a woman, an Alpha or an Epsilon.…” He sighed. Then, in a resolutely cheerful voice, “Anyhow,” he concluded, “there’s one thing we can be certain of; whoever he may have been, he was happy when he was alive. Everybody’s happy now.” “Yes, everybody’s happy now,” echoed Lenina. They had heard the words repeated a hundred and fifty times every night for twelve years.

“LONDON’S FINEST SCENT AND COLOUR ORGAN ALL THE LATEST SYNTHETIC MUSIC.”

Lenina and Henry were yet dancing in another world—the warm, the richly coloured, the infinitely friendly world of _soma_-holiday.


## Chapter 7

The group was now complete, the solidarity circle perfect and without flaw. Man, woman, man, in a ring of endless alternation round the table. Twelve of them ready to be made one, waiting to come together, to be fused, to lose their twelve separate identities in a larger being.

The President made another sign of the T and sat down. The service had begun. The dedicated _soma_tablets were placed in the centre of the table. The loving cup of strawberry ice-cream _soma_ was passed from hand to hand and, with the formula, “I drink to my annihilation,” twelve times quaffed. Then to the accompaniment of the synthetic orchestra the First Solidarity Hymn was sung.

“Ford, we are twelve; oh, make us one, Like drops within the Social River; Oh, make us now together run As swiftly as thy shining Flivver.”... ...And then the loving cup was passed a second time. “I drink to the Greater Being” was now the formula. All drank... ...The Second Solidarity Hymn was sung. “Come, Greater Being, Social Friend, Annihilating Twelve-in-One ! We long to die, for when we end, Our larger life has but begun.”... ...By this time the _soma_ had begun to work. Eyes shone, cheeks were flushed, the inner light of universal benevolence broke out on every face in happy, friendly smiles... ...For the third time the loving cup went round. “I drink to the imminence of His Coming,”... ...The loving cup had made its circuit. Lifting his hand, the President gave a signal; the chorus broke out into the third Solidarity Hymn... ...“Feel how the Greater Being comes ! Rejoice and, in rejoicings, die ! Melt in the music of the drums ! For I am you and you are I.”

The sense of the Coming’s imminence was like an electric tension in the air... ...a wonderful, mysterious, supernatural Voice spoke from above their heads. Very slowly, “Oh, Ford, Ford, Ford,” it said diminishingly and on a descending scale. A sensation of warmth radiated thrillingly out from the solar plexus to every extremity of the bodies of those who listened;... ...Then, in another tone, suddenly, startlingly. “Listen!” trumpeted the voice... ...“The feet of the Greater Being,” it went on,... ...Morgana Rothschild sprang to her feet. “I hear him,” she cried. “I hear him.”... ...Bernard also jumped up and shouted: “I hear him; He’s coming.” But it wasn’t true. He heard nothing and, for him, nobody was coming.

“Orgy-porgy, Ford and fun , Kiss the girls and make them One . Boys at one with girls at peace; Orgy-porgy gives release .”

“Orgy-porgy,” the dancers caught up the liturgical refrain,... ...And as they sang, the lights began slowly to fade—to fade and at the same time to grow warmer, richer, redder, until at last they were dancing in the crimson twilight of an Embryo Store... ...Then the circle wavered, broke, fell in partial disintegration on the ring of couches which surrounded—circle... ...Tenderly the deep Voice crooned and cooed; in the red twilight it was as though some enormous negro dove were hovering benevolently over the now prone or supine dancers.

“Wasn’t it simply wonderful?” She looked at Bernard... ...“Yes, I thought it was wonderful,” he lied and looked away; the sight of her transfigured face was at once an accusation and an ironical reminder of his own separateness... ...“Quite wonderful,” he repeated; but the only thing he could think of was Morgana’s eyebrow.
