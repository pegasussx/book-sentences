## I Laying Plans

The art of war is of vital importance to the State.

It is a matter of life and death, a road either to safety or to ruin. Hence it is a subject of inquiry which can on no account be neglected.

The art of war, then, is governed by five constant factors, to be taken into account in one’s deliberations... ...These are: (1) The Moral Law; (2) Heaven; (3) Earth; (4) The Commander; (5) Method and discipline.

The MORAL LAW causes the people to be in complete accord with their ruler... ...HEAVEN signifies night and day, cold and heat, times and seasons. EARTH comprises distances, great and small; danger and security... ... the chances of life and death. The COMMANDER stands for the virtues of wisdom, sincerely, benevolence, courage and strictness. By METHOD AND DISCIPLINE are to be understood the marshaling of the army in its proper subdivisions... ...the maintenance of roads by which supplies may reach the army, and the control of military expenditure.

Therefore, in your deliberations, when seeking to determine the military conditions, let them be made the basis of a comparison, in this wise:

- (1)Which of the two sovereigns is imbued with the Moral law?
- (2)Which of the two generals has most ability?
- (3)With whom lie the advantages derived from Heaven and Earth?
- (4)On which side is discipline most rigorously enforced?
- (5)Which army is stronger?
- (6)On which side are officers and men more highly trained?
- (7)In which army is there the greater constancy both in reward and punishment?

By means of these seven considerations I can forecast victory or defeat.

Avail yourself also of any helpful circumstances over and beyond the ordinary rules.

All warfare is based on deception. Hence, when able to attack, we must seem unable; when using our forces, we must seem inactive; when we are near, we must make the enemy believe we are far away.

If he is secure at all points, be prepared for him. If he is in superior strength, evade him.

If your opponent is of choleric temper, seek to irritate him. Pretend to be weak, that he may grow arrogant.

Attack him where he is unprepared, appear where you are not expected.

Now the general who wins a battle makes many calculations in his temple ere the battle is fought. The general who loses a battle makes but few calculations beforehand. Thus do many calculations lead to victory, and few calculations to defeat: how much more no calculation at all! It is by attention to this point that I can foresee who is likely to win or lose.

## II Waging War

When you engage in actual fighting, if victory is long in coming, then men’s weapons will grow dull and their ardor will be damped. If you lay siege to a town, you will exhaust your strength.

Now, when your weapons are dulled, your ardor damped, your strength exhausted and your treasure spent, other chieftains will spring up to take advantage of your extremity. Then no man, however wise, will be able to avert the consequences that must ensue.

There is no instance of a country having benefited from prolonged warfare.

It is only one who is thoroughly acquainted with the evils of war can thoroughly understand the profitable way of carrying it on.

Bring war material with you from home, but forage on the enemy. Thus the army will have food enough for its needs.

Contributing to maintain an army at a distance causes the people to be impoverished.

The proximity of an army causes prices to go up; and high prices cause the people’s substance to be drained away. When their substance is drained away, the peasantry will be afflicted by heavy exactions

With this loss of substance and exhaustion of strength, the homes of the people will be stripped bare, and three-tenths of their income will be dissipated; while government expenses for broken chariots, worn-out horses, breast-plates and helmets, bows and arrows, spears and shields, protective mantles, draughtoxen and heavy wagons, will amount to four-tenths of its total revenue.

A wise general makes a point of foraging on the enemy.

In order to kill the enemy, our men must be roused to anger; that there may be advantage from defeating the enemy, they must have their rewards.

In chariot fighting, when ten or more chariots have been taken, those should be rewarded who took the first. Our own flags should be substituted for those of the enemy, and the chariots mingled and used in conjunction with ours. The captured soldiers should be kindly treated and kept.

Using the conquered foe to augment one’s own strength.

In war, then, let your great object be victory, not lengthy campaigns. Thus it may be known that the leader of armies is the arbiter of the people’s fate, the man on whom it depends whether the nation shall be in peace or in peril.

## III Attack by Stratagem

Sun Tzu said: In the practical art of war, the best thing of all is to take the enemy’s country whole and intact; to shatter and destroy it is not so good.

It is better... ...to capture a regiment, a detachment or a company entire than to destroy them.

To fight and conquer in all your battles is not supreme excellence; supreme excellence consists in breaking the enemy’s resistance without fighting.

the highest form of generalship is to balk the enemy’s plans; the next best is to prevent the junction of the enemy’s forces; the next in order is to attack the enemy’s army in the field; and the worst policy of all is to besiege walled cities.

The rule is, not to besiege walled cities if it can possibly be avoided... ...The general, unable to control his irritation, will launch his men to the assault like swarming ants, with the result that one-third of his men are slain, while the town still remains untaken. Such are the disastrous effects of a siege.

The skillful leader subdues the enemy’s troops without any fighting; he captures their cities without laying siege to them; he overthrows their kingdom without lengthy operations in the field.

It is the rule in war, if our forces are ten to the enemy’s one, to surround him; if five to one, to attack him; if twice as numerous, to divide our army into two. If equally matched, we can offer battle; if slightly inferior in numbers, we can avoid the enemy; if quite unequal in every way, we can flee from him.

There are three ways in which a ruler can bring misfortune upon his army:

- (1)By commanding the army to advance or to retreat, being ignorant of the fact that it cannot obey. This is called hobbling the army.
- (2)By attempting to govern an army in the same way as he administers a kingdom, being ignorant of the conditions which obtain in an army. This causes restlessness in the soldier’s minds.
- (3)By employing the officers of his army without discrimination, through ignorance of the military principle of adaptation to circumstances. This shakes the confidence of the soldiers.

When the army is restless and distrustful, trouble is sure to come from the other feudal princes. This is simply bringing anarchy into the army, and flinging victory away.

Five essentials for victory:

- (1)He will win who knows when to fight and when not to fight.
- (2)He will win who knows how to handle both superior and inferior forces.
- (3)He will win whose army is animated by the same spirit throughout all its ranks.
- (4)He will win who, prepared himself, waits to take the enemy unprepared.
- (5)He will win who has military capacity and is not interfered with by the sovereign.

If you know the enemy and know yourself, you need not fear the result of a hundred battles. If you know yourself but not the enemy, for every victory gained you will also suffer a defeat. If you know neither the enemy nor yourself, you will succumb in every battle.
