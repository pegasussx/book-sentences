## I Laying Plans

The art of war is of vital importance to the State.

It is a matter of life and death, a road either to safety or to ruin. Hence it is a subject of inquiry which can on no account be neglected.

The art of war, then, is governed by five constant factors, to be taken into account in one’s deliberations... ...These are: (1) The Moral Law; (2) Heaven; (3) Earth; (4) The Commander; (5) Method and discipline.

The MORAL LAW causes the people to be in complete accord with their ruler... ...HEAVEN signifies night and day, cold and heat, times and seasons. EARTH comprises distances, great and small; danger and security... ... the chances of life and death. The COMMANDER stands for the virtues of wisdom, sincerely, benevolence, courage and strictness. By METHOD AND DISCIPLINE are to be understood the marshaling of the army in its proper subdivisions... ...the maintenance of roads by which supplies may reach the army, and the control of military expenditure.

Therefore, in your deliberations, when seeking to determine the military conditions, let them be made the basis of a comparison, in this wise:

- (1)Which of the two sovereigns is imbued with the Moral law?
- (2)Which of the two generals has most ability?
- (3)With whom lie the advantages derived from Heaven and Earth?
- (4)On which side is discipline most rigorously enforced?
- (5)Which army is stronger?
- (6)On which side are officers and men more highly trained?
- (7)In which army is there the greater constancy both in reward and punishment?

By means of these seven considerations I can forecast victory or defeat.

Avail yourself also of any helpful circumstances over and beyond the ordinary rules.

All warfare is based on deception. Hence, when able to attack, we must seem unable; when using our forces, we must seem inactive; when we are near, we must make the enemy believe we are far away.

If he is secure at all points, be prepared for him. If he is in superior strength, evade him.

If your opponent is of choleric temper, seek to irritate him. Pretend to be weak, that he may grow arrogant.

Attack him where he is unprepared, appear where you are not expected.

Now the general who wins a battle makes many calculations in his temple ere the battle is fought. The general who loses a battle makes but few calculations beforehand. Thus do many calculations lead to victory, and few calculations to defeat: how much more no calculation at all! It is by attention to this point that I can foresee who is likely to win or lose.

## II Waging War

When you engage in actual fighting, if victory is long in coming, then men’s weapons will grow dull and their ardor will be damped. If you lay siege to a town, you will exhaust your strength.

Now, when your weapons are dulled, your ardor damped, your strength exhausted and your treasure spent, other chieftains will spring up to take advantage of your extremity. Then no man, however wise, will be able to avert the consequences that must ensue.

There is no instance of a country having benefited from prolonged warfare.

It is only one who is thoroughly acquainted with the evils of war can thoroughly understand the profitable way of carrying it on.

Bring war material with you from home, but forage on the enemy. Thus the army will have food enough for its needs.

Contributing to maintain an army at a distance causes the people to be impoverished.

The proximity of an army causes prices to go up; and high prices cause the people’s substance to be drained away. When their substance is drained away, the peasantry will be afflicted by heavy exactions

With this loss of substance and exhaustion of strength, the homes of the people will be stripped bare, and three-tenths of their income will be dissipated; while government expenses for broken chariots, worn-out horses, breast-plates and helmets, bows and arrows, spears and shields, protective mantles, draughtoxen and heavy wagons, will amount to four-tenths of its total revenue.

A wise general makes a point of foraging on the enemy.

In order to kill the enemy, our men must be roused to anger; that there may be advantage from defeating the enemy, they must have their rewards.

In chariot fighting, when ten or more chariots have been taken, those should be rewarded who took the first. Our own flags should be substituted for those of the enemy, and the chariots mingled and used in conjunction with ours. The captured soldiers should be kindly treated and kept.

Using the conquered foe to augment one’s own strength.

In war, then, let your great object be victory, not lengthy campaigns. Thus it may be known that the leader of armies is the arbiter of the people’s fate, the man on whom it depends whether the nation shall be in peace or in peril.
