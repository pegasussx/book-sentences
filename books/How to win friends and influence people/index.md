## How this book was written – and why

I conducted courses in public speaking only – courses designed to train adults, by actual experience, to think on their feet and express their ideas with more clarity, more effectiveness and more poise, both in business interviews and before groups. But gradually, as the seasons passed, I realised that as sorely as these adults needed training in effective speaking, they needed still more training in the fine art of getting along with people in everyday business and social contacts.

One can, for example, hire mere technical ability in engineering, accountancy, architecture or any other profession at nominal salaries. But the person who has technical knowledge plus the ability to express ideas, to assume leadership, and to arouse enthusiasm among people – that person is headed for higher earning power.

John D. Rockefeller said that ‘the ability to deal with people is as purchasable a commodity as sugar or coffee.’ ‘And I will pay more for that ability,’ said John D., ‘than for any other under the sun.’

The University of Chicago and the United Y.M.C.A. Schools conducted a survey to determine what adults want to study... ...That survey revealed that health is the prime interest of adults – and that their second interest is people; how to understand and get along with people; how to make people like you; and how to win others to your way of thinking.

> ‘is not knowledge but action.’ And this is an action book. - Dale Carnegie 1936

## Nine suggestions on how to get the most out of this book

If you do have this cardinal endowment, then you can achieve wonders without reading any suggestions for getting the most out of a book... ...Just this: a deep, driving desire to learn, a vigorous determination to increase your ability to deal with people.

Ask yourself just how and when you can apply each suggestion.

Marking and underscoring a book makes it more interesting, and far easier to review rapidly.

The rapidity with which we forget is astonishing. So, if you want to get a real, lasting benefit... ...don’t imagine that skimming through it once will suffice... ...you ought to spend a few hours reviewing it every month.

> ‘If you teach a man anything, he will never learn.’ - Bernard Shaw

Learning is an active process. We learn by doing.

Only knowledge that is used sticks in your mind.

each Saturday... ...process of self-examination and review and appraisal... ...“What mistakes did I make that time?” “What did I do that was right – and in what way could I have improved my performance?” “What lessons can I learn from that experience?”

In order to get the most out of this book:
a. Develop a deep, driving desire to master the principles of human relations.
b. Read each chapter twice before going on to the next one.
c. As you read, stop frequently to ask yourself how you can apply each suggestion.
d. Underscore each important idea.
e. Review this book each month.
f. Apply these principles at every opportunity. Use this volume as a working handbook to help you solve your daily problems.
g. Make a lively game out of your learning by offering some friend a dime or a dollar every time he or she catches you violating one of these principles.
h. Check up each week on the progress you are making. Ask yourself what mistakes you have made, what improvement, what lessons you have learned for the future.
i. Keep notes in the back of this book showing how and when you have applied these principles.

## PART ONE: FUNDAMENTAL TECHNIQUES IN HANDLING PEOPLE

### 1 ‘If You Want to Gather Honey, Don’t Kick Over the Beehive’

> ‘I have spent the best years of my life giving people the lighter pleasures, helping them have a good time, and all I get is abuse, the existence of a hunted man.’ - Al Capone

Capone didn’t condemn himself. He actually regarded himself as a public benefactor – an unappreciated and misunderstood public benefactor.

Ninety-nine times out of a hundred, people don’t criticise themselves for anything no matter how wrong it may be.

B.F. Skinner, the world-famous psychologist, proved through his experiments that an animal rewarded for good behaviour will learn much more rapidly and retain what it learns far more effectively than an animal punished for bad behaviour. Later studies have shown that the same applies to humans. By criticising, we do not make lasting changes and often incur resentment.

The resentment that criticism engenders can demoralise employees, family members and friends, and still not correct the situation that has been condemned.

> ‘Judge not, that ye be not judged.’ - Lincoln

Lincoln saw that. Here was a golden, heaven-sent opportunity – the opportunity to capture Lee’s army and end the war immediately. So, with a surge of hope, Lincoln ordered Meade not to call a council of war but to attack Lee immediately... ...And what did General Meade do? He did the very opposite of what he was told to do... ...In bitter disappointment, Lincoln sat down and wrote Meade this letter... ..."My dear General, I do not believe you appreciate the magnitude of the misfortune involved in Lee’s escape... ...Your golden opportunity is gone, and I am distressed immeasurably because of it."... ...Meade never saw that letter. Lincoln never mailed it... ...it is water under the bridge now. If I send this letter, it will relieve my feelings, but it will make Meade try to justify himself. It will make him condemn me. It will arouse hard feelings, impair all his further usefulness as a commander, and perhaps force him to resign from the army.’

Do you know someone you would like to change and regulate and improve? Good! That is fine. I am all in favour of it. But why not begin on yourself? From a purely selfish standpoint, that is a lot more profitable than trying to improve others – yes, and a lot less dangerous.

> ‘Don’t complain about the snow on your neighbour’s roof, when your own doorstep is unclean.’ - Confucious

If you and I want to stir up a resentment tomorrow that may rankle across the decades and endure until death, just let us indulge in a little stinging criticism – no matter how certain we are that it is justified.

When dealing with people, let us remember we are not dealing with creatures of logic. We are dealing with creatures of emotion, creatures bristling with prejudices and motivated by pride and vanity.

> ‘I will speak ill of no man, and speak all the good I know of everybody.’ - Benjamin Franklin.

Any fool can criticise, condemn and complain – and most fools do. But it takes character and self-control to be understanding and forgiving.

> ‘A great man shows his greatness, by the way he treats little men.’ - Carlyle.

Instead of condemning people, let’s try to understand them. Let’s try to figure out why they do what they do. That’s a lot more profitable and intriguing than criticism; and it breeds sympathy, tolerance and kindness. ‘To know all is to forgive all.’

PRINCIPLE 1: Don’t criticise, condemn or complain.

### 2 The Big Secret of Dealing with People

THERE IS ONLY one way under high heaven to get anybody to do anything... ...And that is by making the other person want to do it.

The only way I can get you to do anything is by giving you what you want.

Sigmund Freud said that everything you and I do springs from two motives: the sex urge and the desire to be great.

John Dewey, one of America’s most profound philosophers, phrased it a bit differently. Dr. Dewey said that the deepest urge in human nature is ‘the desire to be important.’ Remember that phrase: ‘the desire to be important.’

Some of the things most people want include:

1 Health and the preservation of life.
2 Food.
3 Sleep.
4 Money and the things money will buy.
5 Life in the hereafter.
6 Sexual gratification.
7 The well-being of our children.
8 A feeling of importance.

Almost all these wants are usually gratified – all except one. But there is one longing – almost as deep, almost as imperious, as the desire for food or sleep – which is seldom gratified. It is what Freud calls ‘the desire to be great.’ It is what Dewey calls the ‘desire to be important.’

It was this desire for a feeling of importance that inspired Dickens to write his immortal novels. This desire inspired Sir Christopher Wren to design his symphonies in stone. This desire made Rockefeller amass millions that he never spent! And this same desire made the richest family in your town build a house far too large for its requirements.

If you tell me how you get your feeling of importance, I’ll tell you what you are. That determines your character. That is the most significant thing about you.

People sometimes became invalids in order to win sympathy and attention, and get a feeling of importance.

Some authorities declare that people may actually go insane in order to find, in the dreamland of insanity, the feeling of importance that has been denied them in the harsh world of reality.

Why people went insane. Nobody knows for sure. But he did say that many people who go insane find in insanity a feeling of importance that they were unable to achieve in the world of reality.

> ‘I consider my ability to arouse enthusiasm among my people, the greatest asset I possess, and the way to develop the best that is in a person is by appreciation and encouragement. There is nothing else that so kills the ambitions of a person as criticisms from superiors. I never criticise anyone. I believe in giving a person incentive to work. So I am anxious to praise but loath to find fault. If I like anything, I am hearty in my approbation and lavish in my praise.’ - Charles Schwab

‘Once I did bad and that I heard ever/Twice I did good, but that I heard never.’

> ‘There is nothing I need so much as nourishment for my self-esteem.’ - Alfred Lunt

We nourish the bodies of our children and friends and employees, but how seldom do we nourish their self-esteem? We provide them with roast beef and potatoes to build energy, but we neglect to give them kind words of appreciation that would sing in their memories for years like the music of the morning stars.

Of course flattery seldom works with discerning people. It is shallow, selfish and insincere. It ought to fail and it usually does. True, some people are so hungry, so thirsty, for appreciation that they will swallow anything, just as a starving man will eat grass and fishworms.

In the long run, flattery will do you more harm than good. Flattery is counterfeit, and like counterfeit money, it will eventually get you into trouble if you pass it to someone else.

The difference between appreciation and flattery? That is simple. One is sincere and the other insincere.

General Obregon’s philosophy: ‘Don’t be afraid of enemies who attack you. Be afraid of the friends who flatter you.’

‘Flattery is telling the other person precisely what he thinks about himself.’

When we are not engaged in thinking about some definite problem, we usually spend about 95 percent of our time thinking about ourselves. Now, if we stop thinking about ourselves for a while and begin to think of the other person’s good points, we won’t have to resort to flattery so cheap and false that it can be spotted almost before it is out of the mouth.

One of the most neglected virtues of our daily existence is appreciation.

Hurting people not only does not change them, it is never called for.

Emerson said: ‘Every man I meet is my superior in some way. In that, I learn of him.’

Forget flattery. Give honest, sincere appreciation. Be ‘hearty in your approbation and lavish in your praise’

PRINCIPLE 2: Give honest and sincere appreciation.

### 3 He Who Can Do This Has the Whole World with Him. He Who Cannot Walks a Lonely Way

You are interested in what you want. You are eternally interested in it. But no one else is. The rest of us are just like you: we are interested in what we want. So the only way on earth to influence other people is to talk about what they want and show them how to get it.

Every act you have ever performed since the day you were born was performed because you wanted something.

> ‘Action springs out of what we fundamentally desire . . . and the best piece of advice which can be given to would-be persuaders, whether in business, in the home, in the school, in politics, is: First, arouse in the other person an eager want. He who can do this has the whole world with him. He who cannot walks a lonely way.’ - Harry A. Overstreet in Influencing Human Behaviour

Tomorrow you may want to persuade somebody to do something. Before you speak, pause and ask yourself: ‘How can I make this person want to do it?’ That question will stop us from rushing into a situation heedlessly, with futile chatter about our desires.

> ‘If there is any one secret of success, it lies in the ability to get the other person’s point of view and see things from that person’s angle as well as from your own.’ -  Henry Ford

In other words, that in which we are most interested is mentioned last, and the whole effect is one of raising a spirit of antagonism rather than of cooperation.

If salespeople can show us how their services or merchandise will help us solve our problems, they won’t need to sell us. We’ll buy.

Customers like to feel that they are buying – not being sold.

The world is full of people who are grabbing and self-seeking. So the rare individual who unselfishly tries to serve others has an enormous advantage. He has little competition.

> ‘People who can put themselves in the place of other people, who can understand the workings of their minds, need never worry about what the future has in store for them.’ - Owen D. Young

Looking at the other person’s point of view and arousing in him an eager want for something is not to be construed as manipulating that person so that he will do something that is only for your benefit and his detriment. Each party should gain from the negotiation.

> First, arouse in the other person an eager want. He who can do this has the whole world with him. He who cannot walks a lonely way. - Professor Overstreet

> ‘Self-expression is the dominant necessity of human nature.’ - William Winter

PRINCIPLE 3: Arouse in the other person an eager want.

## PART TWO: SIX WAYS TO MAKE PEOPLE LIKE YOU

### 1 Do This and You’ll Be Welcome Anywhere

A dog makes his living by giving you nothing but love.

You can make more friends in two months by becoming interested in other people than you can in two years by trying to get other people interested in you.

I know and you know people who blunder through life trying to wigwag other people into becoming interested in them. Of course, it doesn’t work. People are not interested in you. They are not interested in me. They are interested in themselves – morning, noon and after dinner.

If we merely try to impress people and get people interested in us, we will never have many true, sincere friends. Friends, real friends, are not made that way.

> ‘It is the individual who is not interested in his fellow men who has the greatest difficulties in life and provides the greatest injury to others. It is from among such individuals that all human failures spring.’ - Alfred Adler, the famous Viennese psychologist.

Many magicians would look at the audience and say to themselves, ‘Well, there is a bunch of suckers out there, a bunch of hicks; I’ll fool them all right.’ But Thurston’s method was totally different. He told me that every time he went on stage he said to himself: ‘I am grateful because these people come to see me. They make it possible for me to make my living in a very agreeable way. I’m going to give them the very best I possibly can.’

To be genuinely interested in other people is a most important quality for a salesperson to possess – for any person, for that matter.’

All of us, be we workers in a factory, clerks in an office or even a king upon his throne – all of us like people who admire us. 

At the close of World War I... ...one little boy wrote the Kaiser a simple, sincere letter glowing with kindliness and admiration... ...The Kaiser was deeply touched by this letter and invited the little boy to come to see him. The boy came, so did his mother – and the Kaiser married her.

If we want to make friends, let’s put ourselves out to do things for other people – things that require time, energy, unselfishness and thoughtfulness.

> ‘We are interested in others when they are interested in us.’ - a famous old Roman poet, Publilius Syrus

If you want others to like you, if you want to develop real friendships, if you want to help others at the same time as you help yourself, keep this principle in mind

PRINCIPLE 1: Become genuinely interested in other people.

### 2 A Simple Way to Make a Good First Impression

The expression one wears on one’s face is far more important than the clothes one wears on one’s back.

Actions speak louder than words, and a smile says, ‘I like you. You make me happy. I am glad to see you.’

An insincere grin? No. That doesn’t fool anybody. We know it is mechanical and we resent it. I am talking about a real smile, a heartwarming smile, a smile that comes from within, the kind of smile that will bring a good price in the marketplace.

> ‘People who smile,’ he said, ‘tend to manage, teach and sell more effectively, and to raise happier children. There’s far more information in a smile than a frown. That’s why encouragement is a much more effective teaching device than punishment.’- Professor James V. McConnell,

You must have a good time meeting people if you expect them to have a good time meeting you.

Act as if you were already happy, and that will tend to make you happy.

> Action seems to follow feeling, but really action and feeling go together; and by regulating the action, which is under the more direct control of the will, we can indirectly regulate the feeling, which is not - philosopher William James

Everybody in the world is seeking happiness – and there is one sure way to find it. That is by controlling your thoughts. Happiness doesn’t depend on outward conditions. It depends on inner conditions.

It isn’t what you have or who you are or where you are or what you are doing that makes you happy or unhappy. It is what you think about it.

‘There is nothing either good or bad,’ said Shakespeare, ‘but thinking makes it so.’

> Whenever you go out-of-doors, draw the chin in, carry the crown of the head high, and fill the lungs to the utmost; drink in the sunshine; greet your friends with a smile, and put soul into every handclasp. Do not fear being misunderstood and do not waste a minute thinking about your enemies. Try to fix firmly in your mind what you would like to do; and then, without veering off direction, you will move straight to the goal. Keep your mind on the great and splendid things you would like to do, and then, as the days go gliding away, you will find yourself unconsciously seizing upon the opportunities that are required for the fulfillment of your desire, just as the coral insect takes from the running tide the element it needs. Picture in your mind the able, earnest, useful person you desire to be, and the thought you hold is hourly transforming you into that particular individual . . . Thought is supreme. Preserve a right mental attitude – the attitude of courage, frankness, and good cheer. To think rightly is to create. All things come through desire and every sincere prayer is answered. We become like that on which our hearts are fixed. Carry your chin in and the crown of your head high. We are gods in the chrysalis. - Elbert Hubbard 

> ‘A man without a smiling face must not open a shop.’ - ancient Chinese

Nobody needs a smile so much as those who have none left to give!

PRINCIPLE 2: Smile.

### 3 If You Don’t Do This, You Are Headed for Trouble

The average person is more interested in his or her own name than in all the other names on earth put together. Remember that name and call it easily, and you have paid a subtle and very effective compliment. But forget it or misspell it – and you have placed yourself at a sharp disadvantage.

This policy of remembering and honouring the names of his friends and business associates was one of the secrets of Andrew Carnegie’s leadership.

Benton Love, chairman of Texas Commerce Bancshares, believes that the bigger a corporation gets, the colder it becomes. ‘One way to warm it up,’ he said, ‘is to remember people’s names. The executive who tells me he can’t remember names is at the same time telling me he can’t remember a significant part of his business and is operating on quicksand.’

Half the time we are introduced to a stranger, we chat a few minutes and can’t even remember his or her name by the time we say goodbye.

We should be aware of the magic contained in a name and realise that this single item is wholly and completely owned by the person with whom we are dealing . . .and nobody else.

The name sets the individual apart; it makes him or her unique among all others. The information we are imparting or the request we are making takes on a special importance when we approach the situation with the name of the individual. 

PRINCIPLE 3: Remember that a person’s name is to that person the sweetest and most important sound in any language.

### 4 An Easy Way to Become a Good Conversationalist

All she wanted was an interested listener, so she could expand her ego and tell about where she had been. Was she unusual? No. Many people are like that.

And so I had him thinking of me as a good conversationalist when, in reality, I had been merely a good listener and had encouraged him to talk.

Listening is just as important in one’s home life as in the world of business.

Isaac F. Marcosson, a journalist who interviewed hundreds of celebrities, declared that many people fail to make a favourable impression because they don’t listen attentively. ‘They have been so much concerned with what they are going to say next that they do not keep their ears open . . . Very important people have told me that they prefer good listeners to good talkers, but the ability to listen seems rarer than almost any other good trait.’

Lincoln hadn’t wanted advice. He had wanted merely a friendly, sympathetic listener to whom he could unburden himself. That’s what we all want when we are in trouble.

People who talk only of themselves think only of themselves. And ‘those people who think only of themselves,’ Dr. Nicholas Murray Butley, longtime president of Columbia University, said, ‘are hopelessly uneducated.

If you aspire to be a good conversationalist, be an attentive listener. To be interesting, be interested. Ask questions that other persons will enjoy answering. Encourage them to talk about themselves and their accomplishments.

People you are talking to are a hundred times more intested in themselves and their wants and problems than they are in you and your problems.

PRINCIPLE 4: Be a good listener. Encourage others to talk about themselves.

### 5 How to Interest People

The royal road to a person’s heart is to talk about the things he or she treasures most.

“Because he is a gentleman. He saw you were interested in boats, and he talked about the things he knew would interest and please you. He made himself agreeable.”

Talking in terms of the other person’s interests pays off for both parties.

PRINCIPLE 5: Talk in terms of the other person’s interests.

### 6 How to Make People Like You Instantly

So I said to myself: ‘I am going to try to make that clerk like me. Obviously to make him like me, I must say something nice, not about myself, but about him. So I asked myself, “What is there about him that I can honestly admire?” ’ That is sometimes a hard question to answer, especially with strangers

If we are so contemptibly selfish that we can’t radiate a little happiness and pass on a bit of honest appreciation without trying to get something out of the other person in return – if our souls are no bigger than sour crab apples, we shall meet with the failure we so richly deserve.

I did want something out of that chap. I wanted something priceless. And I got it. I got the feeling that I had done something for him without his being able to do anything whatever in return for me. That is a feeling that flows and sings in your memory long after the incident is past.

Always make the other person feel important.

John Dewey, as we have already noted, said that the desire to be important is the deepest urge in human nature

> ‘The deepest principle in human nature is the craving to be appreciated.’ - William James

probably the most important rule in the world: ‘Do unto others as you would have others do unto you.’ You want the approval of those with whom you come in contact. You want recognition of your true worth. You want a feeling that you are important in your little world. You don’t want to listen to cheap, insincere flattery, but you do crave sincere appreciation. You want your friends and associates to be, as Charles Schwab put it, ‘hearty in their approbation and lavish in their praise.’ All of us want that. So let’s obey the Golden Rule, and give unto others what we would have others give unto us. How? When? Where? The answer is: All the time, everywhere.

Little phrases such as ‘I’m sorry to trouble you,’ ‘Would you be so kind as to – ?’ ‘Won’t you please?’ ‘Would you mind?’ ‘Thank you’ – little courtesies like these oil the cogs of the monotonous grind of everyday life – and incidentally, they are the hallmark of good breeding.

Almost everyone considers himself important, very important.

The unvarnished truth is that almost all the people you meet feel themselves superior to you in some way, and a sure way to their hearts is to let them realise in some subtle way that you realise their importance, and recognise it sincerely.

Emerson said: ‘Every man I meet is my superior in some way. In that, I learn of him.’
