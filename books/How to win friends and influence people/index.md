## How this book was written – and why

I conducted courses in public speaking only – courses designed to train adults, by actual experience, to think on their feet and express their ideas with more clarity, more effectiveness and more poise, both in business interviews and before groups. But gradually, as the seasons passed, I realised that as sorely as these adults needed training in effective speaking, they needed still more training in the fine art of getting along with people in everyday business and social contacts.

One can, for example, hire mere technical ability in engineering, accountancy, architecture or any other profession at nominal salaries. But the person who has technical knowledge plus the ability to express ideas, to assume leadership, and to arouse enthusiasm among people – that person is headed for higher earning power.

John D. Rockefeller said that ‘the ability to deal with people is as purchasable a commodity as sugar or coffee.’ ‘And I will pay more for that ability,’ said John D., ‘than for any other under the sun.’

The University of Chicago and the United Y.M.C.A. Schools conducted a survey to determine what adults want to study... ...That survey revealed that health is the prime interest of adults – and that their second interest is people; how to understand and get along with people; how to make people like you; and how to win others to your way of thinking.

> ‘is not knowledge but action.’ And this is an action book. - Dale Carnegie 1936

## Nine suggestions on how to get the most out of this book

If you do have this cardinal endowment, then you can achieve wonders without reading any suggestions for getting the most out of a book... ...Just this: a deep, driving desire to learn, a vigorous determination to increase your ability to deal with people.

Ask yourself just how and when you can apply each suggestion.

Marking and underscoring a book makes it more interesting, and far easier to review rapidly.

The rapidity with which we forget is astonishing. So, if you want to get a real, lasting benefit... ...don’t imagine that skimming through it once will suffice... ...you ought to spend a few hours reviewing it every month.

> ‘If you teach a man anything, he will never learn.’ - Bernard Shaw

Learning is an active process. We learn by doing.

Only knowledge that is used sticks in your mind.

each Saturday... ...process of self-examination and review and appraisal... ...“What mistakes did I make that time?” “What did I do that was right – and in what way could I have improved my performance?” “What lessons can I learn from that experience?”

In order to get the most out of this book:
a. Develop a deep, driving desire to master the principles of human relations.
b. Read each chapter twice before going on to the next one.
c. As you read, stop frequently to ask yourself how you can apply each suggestion.
d. Underscore each important idea.
e. Review this book each month.
f. Apply these principles at every opportunity. Use this volume as a working handbook to help you solve your daily problems.
g. Make a lively game out of your learning by offering some friend a dime or a dollar every time he or she catches you violating one of these principles.
h. Check up each week on the progress you are making. Ask yourself what mistakes you have made, what improvement, what lessons you have learned for the future.
i. Keep notes in the back of this book showing how and when you have applied these principles.
