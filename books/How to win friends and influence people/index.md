## How this book was written – and why

I conducted courses in public speaking only – courses designed to train adults, by actual experience, to think on their feet and express their ideas with more clarity, more effectiveness and more poise, both in business interviews and before groups. But gradually, as the seasons passed, I realised that as sorely as these adults needed training in effective speaking, they needed still more training in the fine art of getting along with people in everyday business and social contacts.

One can, for example, hire mere technical ability in engineering, accountancy, architecture or any other profession at nominal salaries. But the person who has technical knowledge plus the ability to express ideas, to assume leadership, and to arouse enthusiasm among people – that person is headed for higher earning power.

John D. Rockefeller said that ‘the ability to deal with people is as purchasable a commodity as sugar or coffee.’ ‘And I will pay more for that ability,’ said John D., ‘than for any other under the sun.’

The University of Chicago and the United Y.M.C.A. Schools conducted a survey to determine what adults want to study... ...That survey revealed that health is the prime interest of adults – and that their second interest is people; how to understand and get along with people; how to make people like you; and how to win others to your way of thinking.

> ‘is not knowledge but action.’ And this is an action book. - Dale Carnegie 1936

## Nine suggestions on how to get the most out of this book

If you do have this cardinal endowment, then you can achieve wonders without reading any suggestions for getting the most out of a book... ...Just this: a deep, driving desire to learn, a vigorous determination to increase your ability to deal with people.

Ask yourself just how and when you can apply each suggestion.

Marking and underscoring a book makes it more interesting, and far easier to review rapidly.

The rapidity with which we forget is astonishing. So, if you want to get a real, lasting benefit... ...don’t imagine that skimming through it once will suffice... ...you ought to spend a few hours reviewing it every month.

> ‘If you teach a man anything, he will never learn.’ - Bernard Shaw

Learning is an active process. We learn by doing.

Only knowledge that is used sticks in your mind.

each Saturday... ...process of self-examination and review and appraisal... ...“What mistakes did I make that time?” “What did I do that was right – and in what way could I have improved my performance?” “What lessons can I learn from that experience?”

In order to get the most out of this book:
a. Develop a deep, driving desire to master the principles of human relations.
b. Read each chapter twice before going on to the next one.
c. As you read, stop frequently to ask yourself how you can apply each suggestion.
d. Underscore each important idea.
e. Review this book each month.
f. Apply these principles at every opportunity. Use this volume as a working handbook to help you solve your daily problems.
g. Make a lively game out of your learning by offering some friend a dime or a dollar every time he or she catches you violating one of these principles.
h. Check up each week on the progress you are making. Ask yourself what mistakes you have made, what improvement, what lessons you have learned for the future.
i. Keep notes in the back of this book showing how and when you have applied these principles.

## PART ONE: FUNDAMENTAL TECHNIQUES IN HANDLING PEOPLE

### 1 ‘If You Want to Gather Honey, Don’t Kick Over the Beehive’

> ‘I have spent the best years of my life giving people the lighter pleasures, helping them have a good time, and all I get is abuse, the existence of a hunted man.’ - Al Capone

Capone didn’t condemn himself. He actually regarded himself as a public benefactor – an unappreciated and misunderstood public benefactor.

Ninety-nine times out of a hundred, people don’t criticise themselves for anything no matter how wrong it may be.

B.F. Skinner, the world-famous psychologist, proved through his experiments that an animal rewarded for good behaviour will learn much more rapidly and retain what it learns far more effectively than an animal punished for bad behaviour. Later studies have shown that the same applies to humans. By criticising, we do not make lasting changes and often incur resentment.

The resentment that criticism engenders can demoralise employees, family members and friends, and still not correct the situation that has been condemned.

> ‘Judge not, that ye be not judged.’ - Lincoln

Lincoln saw that. Here was a golden, heaven-sent opportunity – the opportunity to capture Lee’s army and end the war immediately. So, with a surge of hope, Lincoln ordered Meade not to call a council of war but to attack Lee immediately... ...And what did General Meade do? He did the very opposite of what he was told to do... ...In bitter disappointment, Lincoln sat down and wrote Meade this letter... ..."My dear General, I do not believe you appreciate the magnitude of the misfortune involved in Lee’s escape... ...Your golden opportunity is gone, and I am distressed immeasurably because of it."... ...Meade never saw that letter. Lincoln never mailed it... ...it is water under the bridge now. If I send this letter, it will relieve my feelings, but it will make Meade try to justify himself. It will make him condemn me. It will arouse hard feelings, impair all his further usefulness as a commander, and perhaps force him to resign from the army.’

Do you know someone you would like to change and regulate and improve? Good! That is fine. I am all in favour of it. But why not begin on yourself? From a purely selfish standpoint, that is a lot more profitable than trying to improve others – yes, and a lot less dangerous.

> ‘Don’t complain about the snow on your neighbour’s roof, when your own doorstep is unclean.’ - Confucious

If you and I want to stir up a resentment tomorrow that may rankle across the decades and endure until death, just let us indulge in a little stinging criticism – no matter how certain we are that it is justified.

When dealing with people, let us remember we are not dealing with creatures of logic. We are dealing with creatures of emotion, creatures bristling with prejudices and motivated by pride and vanity.

> ‘I will speak ill of no man, and speak all the good I know of everybody.’ - Benjamin Franklin.

Any fool can criticise, condemn and complain – and most fools do. But it takes character and self-control to be understanding and forgiving.

> ‘A great man shows his greatness, by the way he treats little men.’ - Carlyle.

Instead of condemning people, let’s try to understand them. Let’s try to figure out why they do what they do. That’s a lot more profitable and intriguing than criticism; and it breeds sympathy, tolerance and kindness. ‘To know all is to forgive all.’

PRINCIPLE 1: Don’t criticise, condemn or complain.
