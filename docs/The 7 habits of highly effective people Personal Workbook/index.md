Remember! Spoiling yourself once in a while is actually good for you. It triggers endorphins. It's satisfying. You don't have to throw down the self discipline gauntlet, just relax a little. Indulging can help you control cravings so they don't turn into binge-fests. Balance is about enjoying bliss, not just cutting out the junk.

The most important ingredient we put into any relationship is not what we say or do, but what we are.
