This project is a collection of my favorite sentences from the books I read.

~These are not to be taken as summaries from the books, just some random sentences from here and there. Sometimes more than a few.~ Lately, they have become actual summaries of the books. Which are actually quite useful, because I donâ€™t need to have the book with me if I want to review something about it.

It all started some years ago with a Google Keep note. When I reached the characters limit, I moved to a Google Doc. Then, while reading the Pragmatic Programmer, I thought this project could be a better way to keep and share them with people that can find them useful or interesting.

I have read other books before these (not as many as I would have liked), however, I just collected sentences from the ones here.
