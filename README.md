# Book Sentences

This is a collection of my favorite sentences from the books I read. These are not to be taken as summaries from the books, just some random sentences from here and there. 

It all started some years ago with a Google Keep note and when I reached the characters limit I moved to a Google Doc. Then, while reading the Pragmatic Programmer I wanted to share this with other people and created this project.

While reading the Pragmatic Programmer I realized that sometimes some words or part of the sentence were not relevant to me, so I skipped that part to continue after.
